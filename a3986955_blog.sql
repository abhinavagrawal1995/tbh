A mirror to himself in that, he was the exact opposite of what he was and a mirror to others in that, they could see the faults in themselves when Jobs was around.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHis saga is the entrepreneurial myth written large. He cofounded Apple in his Parent’s garage with Steve Wozniak, was ousted a decade later and then returned, twelve years later to rescue Apple Inc. from the brink of bankruptcy and in 2011, helped Apple become the world’s most valuable company. In this process, he helped transform seven major industries; Personal Computing, animated movies, digital music, smartphones, tablet computing, retail stores and digital publishing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="line-height: 1.5;"><a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/618w_steve_jobs_memorial_gallery_2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-191" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/618w_steve_jobs_memorial_gallery_2-300x183.jpg" alt="618w_steve_jobs_memorial_gallery_2" width="300" height="183" /></a></span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="line-height: 1.5;">And yet, his life was so much more than this.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHis life was always about living it in binary terms. A product was insanely great or a piece of crap, a dish served to him was the best thing ever or downright inedible. And similarly, the highs of his life were unimaginable but the lows were rock bottom and terrifying. But there was only one singularity to his life, he loved what he did. And in his commencement address at Stanford in 2005, that was what he asked of the graduating students, to keep looking for what they love, to not settle for anything less.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“The only way to do great work is to love what you do. Keep looking, Don’t Settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on, So keep looking until you find it, Don’t settle.”\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/alg-steve-jobs-stanford-jpg.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-192" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/alg-steve-jobs-stanford-jpg-300x200.jpg" alt="alg-steve-jobs-stanford-jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>\r\n\r\nHe was a perfection Nazi, one obsessed with perfecting each bit of the each work he ever did. During the development of almost every product he ever created, Jobs hit the pause button and went back to the drawing board because he felt it wasn’t perfect.  His perfectionism extended even to parts unseen. As a young boy, he had helped his father build a fence around their backyard, and he was told they had to use as much care on the back of the fence as on the front. “Nobody will ever know,” Steve said. His father replied “But you will know.”\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipadiphoneipod.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-193" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipadiphoneipod-300x250.jpg" alt="ipadiphoneipod" width="300" height="250" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHe took his father’s lessons to heart and today, as a person who read a 560 page biography of him, there are many lessons I’ve learnt.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe book by Walter Isaacson is only a vast collection of anecdotes, incidents and happenings that shaped his life but for me, it is a Bible, having an answer to each question of mine.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/FB_IMG_1430991572257.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-189" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/FB_IMG_1430991572257-300x294.jpg" alt="FB_IMG_1430991572257" width="300" height="294" /></a>\r\n\r\nI believe that every great act in Human History can trace its roots back to the right person picking up the right book.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI know that I’ve picked up the right book, I just need to become the right person', 'A Tale of Processors and Poetry', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'a-tale-of-processors-and-poetry', '', '', '2015-05-23 17:04:42', '2015-05-23 11:34:42', '', 0, 'http://blog.thebookhub.in/?p=187', 0, 'post', '', 0);

You could just push them into a room full of books or a library and never expect them to come out. A nice cup of coffee and a quiet place is all they need to fulfill their wishes. Gift them books to win their hearts or make their birthdays perfect. The way we feel about books is the way Belle is ‘Beauty and the Beast’ reacts when the Beast shows her the library. Funny but true. The smell of the new pages and the ones that are ancient with age; it’s like a harmless drug for readers. A million stories that spark off our imagination and apart from imparting education, they help us to discover the fact that words may be just mundane like other things to many people but for us, they’re like beautiful galaxies woven and spun together to form a flawlessly stunning universe. \r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images-1.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images-1.jpg" alt="images (1)" width="194" height="259" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-125" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere are words for every genre – that’s their beauty. There’s something for everything. Technology may be a boon to mankind and you could say it’s a blessing for those who don’t like carrying books around in their bags and take the care of maintaining them, but then every coin has a flip side: the screen of ‘Kindle’ could crack for all you know, one click of a button and you could just lose your opportunity of reading. You could drop them and damage them. E-books stored on laptops and computers; they have a chance of getting lost with the hard-drive crash or any technological glitch for that matter. Handling them with care is another clause that comes with technological products. Not to forget the strain on your eyes when you keep staring at a screen for hours while reading and then comes along another problem – ‘Kindle’ runs on battery that can expire or run out of charge or even get damaged. Without the battery, ‘Kindle’ is basically a box with books that can’t be accessed. Books, you can carry them anywhere, anytime in any condition; no worries of the ‘Kindle’ not being able to withstand extreme temperatures. Books, you fix them up with tape, put some classic binding and glue them up; all at a reasonable cost. No need to go to a technician and spend a thousand bucks and wait for days to just read a few books!!  I mean c’mon! Paper is so much better than pixels!\r\n1.	True ownership of a book:\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images-300x168.jpg" alt="images" width="300" height="168" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-126" /></a>\r\n\r\nIt’s true that you can own a book and an ‘e-book’. But even the ownership is different in nature. Book makes you have a feel of the ‘physical ownership’, in hard-copy. It becomes a part of yourself. You can hug it and go to sleep. Sit peacefully on a beach, reading a book, with the waves kissing your body and receding, no worries of dropping your book in the water and losing it because the water seeped into the hardware and destroyed it. It’s your constant companion. Scribble notes and ideas, literally and symbolically mark your territory over it. The highlights and markings are one aspect. Then comes the interaction and engaging process with the book.\r\n The plus point – there are visible marks that you’ve bonded with your book. Only if you have a proper book, will people ever know you’ve read it; or anyone else for that matter. You see bent and ‘dog-eared’ pages, a shaking and loose book spine, signs of age and use. People will come to know that the reader has been impacted by the book, the story has had an effect on their lives. On the other hand, send an e-book to someone else; if you get it back, you’ll see the highlights and notes gone, because that’s just how technology is. The ownership belongs to you or your device, not to the book. Last but not the least, when you often to go to a library and see an old book, flip through its pages. See the notes and ideas written over the pages. You’ll get an idea of what kind of experiences different people had with the book and how it has made a mark on those lives. This can never be reproduced in an e-book format.\r\n\r\n2.	Loan  a Book:\r\nYou ask me why I hate e-books; they CAN’T be loaned! They have some kind of digital rights management involved which bonds a book to a particular owner. On buying a Kindle book, you could have a copy of it on your device but then again! There comes the system of linking the devices with various accounts. It’s all painful technological processes everywhere just to give yourself the pleasure of reading a great story. In case of books, you can loan one or two or any number. That’s the best – anywhere, any way, any time how much ever. In case of Kindle, you have to loan your entire reading device; basically, either you loan everything or nothing at all. Then again, even if an e-book doesn’t have any digital management rights, loaning it is very different from actual loaning. It’s actually ‘duplicating’ a book. When you loan someone a book, they actually witness your experience with it. There’s a level of trust, intimacy and shared experience in loaning books which can’t be found in electronic books.\r\n\r\n3.	A single tasking device. \r\nA book is inherently opposed to multi-tasking. Not more than one or two tasks can be performed while reading it. This indirectly implies that a reader can devote nearly 90% of his attention to the story that he/she is reading. No distraction, no problem.  This allows the reader to have the best possible reading experience and actually enjoy it. E-books on the other hand, are technological devices crafted in such a way that multi-tasking is made possible. Stored in I-Pads or anything else for that matter, e-books contain hyper-links and built-in dictionary and many other applications somehow related to reading which drive the reader away from the wholesome reading experience. They buzz, beep and disengage the reader in many ways.\r\n\r\n4.	One can buy a used book.\r\nWalk down a street and see if you can see even a single e-book store as compared to outlets selling used books. E-books can never be USED, let’s face it. They stay cold, unblemished and untouched but only duplicated for years to come. Their prices never change, they can never be dug out of boxes like long lost treasure and never suddenly turn up like unexpected old gifts from us to us. They can never be loaned or resold. They stay fresh, unused and forever sustained. There are NO  rare first editions or special editions. A used book will be a vestige of the past but irreplaceable and vintage.\r\n\r\nBecause books are the BEST inventions till date!\r\n', 'Why books will always be magical', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '123-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-04-18 23:42:16', '2015-04-18 18:12:16', '', 123, 'http://blog.thebookhub.in/123-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

I would always picture myself wearing crisp, ironed formal clothes, meeting with a host of people from all over the world and travelling round the globe. I have had the ‘I-want-to-be-the-President-of-India’ phase or the ‘my-life-is-going-to-be-a-long-fancy-holiday’ phase. People would tell me how unrealistic a kid I could sometimes be. But I would pay no heed to them. Basically, Bollywood had ruined me forever!\r\n\r\nI am certain that most of those who are reading this must, at some point or the other, have had similar dreams. Vague, impractical, distorted images of our future selves, fashioned from the cameras of impassioned daydreaming. Bursting our bubble, however, reality did to our larger-than-life ideas what a flame does to a moth. At every step, the impediments grew mightier.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/download.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-166 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/download.jpg" alt="download" width="456" height="303" /></a>\r\nMoving to a metropolitan city turns one’s life around. Meeting new people, engaging oneself in dialogue and discussions, looking after oneself because no one else will- opens our eyes to the real world, marking a departure from our utopian wonderlands. A world where no matter how good one might think they are, they will always find an equal, if not better, match. A place where one realises that they will soon be expected to shoulder serious responsibilities, to get one’s life together and to prove one’s mettle while they are at it. A place where a line of distinction is drawn between being well-trained and being well educated; where one finally comes to realise that test scores are really just numbers, that often prove to be an insufficient and unjust parameter to judge a person’s true calibre. All this, if one does not lose their sanity amidst the bright lights and deafening noise, of course.\r\n\r\nThe flip side has a different story to tell. For someone who has led a simplistic lifestyle, the fast-paced atmosphere of an urban setting can be scary to cope up with. For them, the competition is too fierce, the pressure too high, the voices too loud, the choices too extreme, the expectations too burdensome and life too twisted. They often lose themselves in the search of things that are far beyond their reach.\r\n\r\nHaving lived in a metropolitan for about two years, makes me wonder, like anyone else, as to where my life is headed. While big cities offer varied opportunities, they also baffle young minds. A hundred different people narrating a hundred different versions of a strange tale-what to do and what not to do. Enveloped in such surroundings, it can be difficult to hold on to one’s ground. But amidst all this, there is an invisible force drawing us back to the city. The city which teaches one that none will ever know them the way they know themselves, and that they may never know someone else too well either; the city that encourages one to embrace challenges and take risks; that which pushes one to stand right back up after every fall; that which reminds one how people come and go but the only thing they can constantly hold onto is, the self- mind and soul intact; that which trains one to believe, and to never underestimate the wonders of honest hard work. This city- your city- ensures that YOU never give up.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Mumbai_Skyline_at_Night.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-167 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Mumbai_Skyline_at_Night-300x148.jpg" alt="Mumbai_Skyline_at_Night" width="448" height="221" /></a>\r\nAs a student, it is not hard for me to imagine how much one can miss being home, how empty life can seem without good friends at one’s immediate disposal, how lonely one can get in big groups, how comforting it is to sit among family cradled in all of the universe’s love and affection and how satisfying <em>maa ke haath ka khaana</em> can taste. But if you ask me, I will tell you that there is a calling within each of us that makes us miss the city life, makes us want to go back. Because, yes, home will always be home; and <em>ghar ka khaana</em> is irreplaceable; and playing Holi with college friends and colleagues will never be as much fun as playing with kids in the colony; but none of this is the key to the future of our dreams. The city is. The inclination towards being independent is not something one can easily give up. We all like being less answerable, we all appreciate our privacy and space being respected. So when one sets their heart to conquering a milestone, they make their peace with distances, inconveniences and memories. After all, home is where the heart is.\r\n\r\nIn retrospection, one may eventually come to terms with the fact that they may not be the same person they were three years ago. That they now understand better, analyse better and can take informed, pragmatic decisions. One’s problems have escalated from acquiring permission to watch a movie with friends to persistently fighting the dedicated battle against losing oneself in the crowd. Priorities have changed from buying that SUV to sending one’s parents on a holiday that they rightfully deserve. Realisation dawns upon us kids that we probably are our own superheroes. And the city plays a pivotal role in teaching us this.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/looking-at-sky.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-168 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/looking-at-sky-300x216.jpg" alt="looking-at-sky" width="378" height="272" /></a>\r\n<p style="text-align: center">Growing up may not have been the best thing that happened to us, but the city sure made it one hell of a ride!</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center"></p>', 'The City', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-city', '', '', '2015-05-13 14:26:21', '2015-05-13 08:56:21', '', 0, 'http://blog.thebookhub.in/?p=165', 0, 'post', '', 10);

While for many years, I blindly believed this statement, recently I decided to do a background check at the legitimacy of this statement. Although initially everything seemed well in place, I slowly started stumbling upon factual errors and wrong information being sold to the public. Taking for granted that a majority of the readers will not know much about the backgrounds of the works, Dan Brown added mysterious societies and strange rituals which appealed to the audience, even more so because the audience mostly if not wholly believed that the these societies and rituals existed. I however felt a little cheated for being made to believe something that is not true and hence I would like to bring out a few factual errors in what is considered Dan Brown’s best work, The Da Vinci Code.\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong><em>The Priory of Sion:</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nAccording to the book, the Priory of Sion is an ancient organization connected to Goddess worship. Dan Brown writes that the organization was founded in 1099 and it was named after the Biblical Mount Zion. The truth is however very different. The Priory of Sion was actually founded in1956 by Pierre Plantard, Andre Bonhomme and others and was named after a mountain in France.\r\n<ol start="2">\r\n	<li><strong><em>Opus Dei</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThe book claims that the Opus Dei is a monastic order which is the Pope’s ‘personal prelature’. Silas the murderer is said to be an Opus Dei monk who uses a cilice to flagellate himself and receives very deep wounds. Factually Opus Dei has no monks and Dan Brown greatly exaggerates the effects of voluntary mortification of flesh as the kind of wounds described in the book cannot be caused from a normal cilice.\r\n<ol start="3">\r\n	<li><strong><em>The Rosslyn Chapel</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThe Chapel is a major feature in the last part of the novel, though many incorrect assertions were made about the structure. The book states that the Chapel was built by the Knights Templar, and contains a six-pointed Star of David worn into the stone floor although such star has never been seen in the floor. Also the chapel was founded by William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness of the Scoto-Norman Sinclair family and not by the Knights Templar\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR6KbQasx634TE8fmh9Y0XugyTcl0LNAVPcupet5a7eq9-8aM0U" alt="" width="259" height="194" /></p>\r\n\r\n<ol start="4">\r\n	<li><strong><em>The Vatican</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nIn the story, the Vatican is said to be the center of power in the early Catholic Church. It is said that that there is a reference to the Vatican in the Gnostic Writings of the 4<sup>th</sup> century. However it was not until the 15<sup>th</sup> century that there was anything like official power in the vicinity of the Vatican Hill in Rome. In the 4<sup>th</sup> century all that existed of the Vatican was a little more than a church and cemetery by the side of the road. Also the book claims that St. Peter’s is a cathedral, although Saint Peter’s is more of a church technically.\r\n<ol start="5">\r\n	<li><strong><em>Geography</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThe book’s storyline that the “Albino Monk” was arrested in France, imprisoned in Andorra and escaped to Spain, demonstrates the lack of basic research that would be gleaned from a quick glance at a map or tourist guide. It is improbable that someone arrested along the French coast would be imprisoned in another country (in this case Andorra which is a different jurisdiction and several hundred kilometers away up in the Pyrenean Mountains). After the scene in the Temple Church, London, the heroes of the story take the tube from Temple Station to King’s College. In fact King’s College is nearer to the Temple Church than to Temple Station, and any tube journey would have carried them further away from King’s College. Brown also states “The chapel’s geographic coordinates fall precisely on the north-south meridian that runs through Glastonbury”. This statement is incorrect: Rosslyn Chapel lies more towards the east-west meridian. Brown appears to have confused geographic north with magnetic north.\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone" src="http://i.infopls.com/images/Europemap-2010.gif" alt="" width="713" height="535" />\r\n\r\nIt is not just the The Da Vinci Code. All of Dan Brown’s works have major factual fallacies, which have been introduced to take advantage of the fact that any mysterious object gains much more interest if it is rendered to be factually correct. As far as the story is concerned, the suspense, the thrill, the build-up, everything is very well put and the book has all the ingredients to make an interesting read, however keeping the factual inaccuracies in mind, my outlook of the book has changed from “A must read book, filled with well researched information which provides an insight into history along with an interesting storyline” to “Just another historical fiction thriller”.', 'The Da Vinci Code: Of Facts or Fallacies?', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-da-vinci-code-of-facts-or-fallacies', '', '', '2015-06-13 19:56:52', '2015-06-13 14:26:52', '', 0, 'http://blog.thebookhub.in/?p=232', 0, 'post', '', 0);

It is a bit surprising, to say the least, that people would deliberately choose a character that is portrayed as vindictive, resentful and even criminal over someone who is amiable and righteous.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nA memorable tale is always determined by its plot and more importantly, its characters. A thrilling chemistry between the antagonist and protagonist that leaves the audience at the edge of their seats is sure to be a blockbuster or a bestseller. But the best stories that are a class apart are those with a well-defined villain.\r\nSure, ultimately the hero saves the day but it''s the villain that steals the show. Here are a few reasons why the hated are really the most loved.\r\n\r\n1. There would be no story without a villain.\r\n\r\nOne can only appreciate the light once you see the darkness. A hero''s ''pristine nature'' can be shown if has a plan to foil and an anti-hero to defeat. They are rivals yet complementary to each other and a perfect plot.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img id="irc_mi" class=" aligncenter" src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/0_mEDo0D7f4/hqdefault.jpg" alt="" width="311" height="233" />\r\n\r\n2. An engrossing back story.\r\n\r\nBehind their devilish schemes, heinous intentions and hardened personalities, lie a hundred secrets why villains turned into monsters.\r\n\r\nTake for example, Bill the Butcher (or William Cutting), the antagonist in Gangs of New York. Inspired by real life gangster William Poole, Bill was a violent man hell-bent on revenge against immigrants who were responsible for his father''s death. He was known for his moral code, his patriotism and sense of honour. Today he is famously remembered for his last words, "Thank God... I died a true American."\r\n\r\n<img id="irc_mi" class=" aligncenter" src="http://www.monologuedb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/daniel-day-lewis-bill-the-butcher-cutting-gangs-of-new-york.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="308" />\r\n\r\nHeathcliff (Wuthering Heights), an iconic villain in English literature is a character still yet to be fully understood even after a century of his existence. Born as a homeless orphan but sheltered and mentored by Mr. Earnshaw, Heathcliff, Heathcliff falls in love with Catherine Earnshaw who betrays their love and marries Edgar Linton, a man of better social and economic background. In a rage of vengeance and sadness, Heathcliff becomes a living nightmare in a gentleman''s disguise.\r\n\r\n<img id="irc_mi" class=" aligncenter" src="http://36.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnnalzPlNN1qe5f96o1_1280.jpg" alt="" width="411" height="274" />\r\n\r\n3. Honestly, they''re smarter.\r\n\r\nThere''s nothing more appealing than cunning intellect and a cunning intellect is a villain''s forte.\r\n\r\nLight Yagami (Death Note) could control death and the supernatural.\r\n\r\n<img id="irc_mi" class=" aligncenter" src="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/11495/240324-73255-light-yagami.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="225" />\r\n\r\nMister Sinister (X-Men), a scientific genius could alter his human genome to be invulnerable and ageless. Also he resuscitated Apocalypse, carrier of the first mutant X-gene. That''s pretty damn smart.\r\n\r\n<img id="irc_mi" class=" aligncenter" src="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11113/111133725/3864874-1.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="301" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMrs. Eleanor Iselin (The Manchurian Candidate) is a ruthless Communist agent who plans to take over America. Her cold blooded and domineering attitude towards even her husband and son and her ambition to succeed makes her one of the smartest villains of all time.\r\n\r\n<strong><img id="irc_mi" class=" aligncenter" src="http://www.morethings.com/fan/manchurian_candidate/plot-revealed-angela_lansbury-laurence_harvey09.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="222" /></strong>\r\n\r\n4. People are attracted to imperfections.\r\n\r\nEveryone wants to be perfect but we''re not. Heroes on paper and screens are the closest depiction to perfection. They represent goodwill, selflessness and struggle. They represent silver linings.\r\n\r\nVillains are a realistic portrayal of mankind''s flaws, exaggerations of man''s sins. They are greedy (Shylock), ambitious (Macbeth), broken (Voldemort), vengeful (Maleficent) and desirable (Jennifer in Jennifer''s Body). There is raw, crass and unabashed emotion in a villain which makes a story all the more better. In the real world, there is no black and white but shades of grey.\r\n\r\n<img id="irc_mi" class="" src="http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120727155045/disney/images/5/5e/Puzzle-clementoni-disney-villains-panorama-1000-p-CLM39088.5-0.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="272" />\r\n\r\n5. We cling to the hope that they might change sides.\r\n\r\nContinuing from the previous point, we truly want to believe that a villain has a human heart and even though tortured can seek redemption,\r\n\r\nDr. Gru from the Despicable Me series is a classic example. From conniving to steal the moon to become a doting father of three is a complete and delightful change of character.\r\n\r\nMaybe Claude Frollo (The Hunchback of Notre Dame) could find it in his otherwise compassionate heart to give way to reason (for he was a knowledgeable man) and let go of his unrequited love for Esmeralda.\r\n\r\nMaybe Loki (Marvel Universe) accepts his fate as an adopted brother and rather helps Thor in the safekeeping of Asgard.\r\n\r\n<img id="irc_mi" class=" aligncenter" src="http://www.despicablemegames.info/games/images/18-despicable-me-2-animation-movie.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="348" />\r\n\r\nThis is where our imagination and expectations go wild, fellow readers.\r\n\r\n6. Psychos are entertaining. :)\r\n\r\nThere are some villains who capture our hearts but there are some who are simply blood-curdling and we love every second of it.\r\n\r\nChristoph Waltz as SS Colonel Hans Landa (Inglorious Basterds) was horrifying and brilliant.\r\n\r\nAmerican Psycho is now generated as academic work because of Christian Bale''s smooth transitions as a man of great reputation to a psychotic serial killer.\r\n\r\nAlso, how can one forget the loathsome woman in pink, Dolores Umbridge or Cruella De Vil.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tumblr_mgn2k8hSVW1r1mtsdo1_500.gif"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-250 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tumblr_mgn2k8hSVW1r1mtsdo1_500-300x181.gif" alt="tumblr_mgn2k8hSVW1r1mtsdo1_500" width="300" height="181" /></a>\r\n\r\n7. (Bonus reason) A good looking villain is like icing on a cake.\r\n\r\nWith the slyness of a fox and the looks of an angel, our hearts turn into a frenzy of hate and passion.

The moment I  penned the last word of my story, I felt satisfied knowing that I had done justice to the characters of my story. It was a beautiful feeling. But then, my heart broke knowing that I had to bid goodbye to them.Though it wasn''t really a goodbye.''</em>\r\n\r\nHonestly, I wasn''t intending on writing what I''m going to write at this moment. My first thought was, ''I had an exhilarating experience. I can''t make a draft of it and then write it out. It''ll be better if I''m spontaneous.''\r\n\r\nHere I am.\r\n\r\nI looked at myself in the mirror. My eyes resembled those of Lord Voldemort - scarlet red. Yes, they were tired and looked bloodshot after the period of time I spent trying to figure out the character and personality of my story''s protagonist. It had been a good number of two hours and till now I just knew that my protagonist was a 15 year old girl who had cancer and then my thoughts trailed off into a fading train of words as my eyes flitted to the half written page.\r\n\r\n<img src="https://dkzstslcvgwbc.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/resize/inline_image/images12_0-367x275.jpg" alt="" />\r\n\r\nMy inspiration looked as bleak as a candle flame that was dying out. I had tobring it back before it went extinct. With full determination, I picked up my pen, refraining myself from looking at the time, for time meant nothing for me right now. I had a story to write.\r\n\r\nI happily toiled away and burnt the midnight oil. Occasionally, there was a violent outbreak in my mind when a chunk of ideas used to aggressively knock on the doors of my brain, trying to get in. With great difficulty, I turned a deaf ear to them, for I knew that ''too many cooks spoil a good broth.'' The most painful and crucial part was the game changer, the twist in the story. It''s never easy to decide how you want your story to go about, specially when you''re not sure of what''s going to happen next and also when you don''t know what kind of literature people like reading. There are so many different tastes and preferences but just one story.\r\n\r\n''Pen down the first scenario that comes to the mind'' - that was the easiest strategy I planned to adopt. I am no pro at writing but only an emerging writer. I had to give this piece a lovely form with the simplest ideas. I had to give my characters the closure they needed. My characters were like my children, my own family and I couldn''t abandon them on some random page of a diary!\r\n\r\n<img src="https://dkzstslcvgwbc.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/resize/inline_image/family_1-347x257.jpg" alt="" />\r\n\r\nIn sometime I realized my growing attachment to my newly found family that I had discovered in the hidden corners of my own mind. I found myself laughing, crying and rejoicing with them; protecting them from every destructive and masochistic thought that came to my mind. They were a part of me and hurting them would be like hurting myself.\r\n\r\nI was halfway through my story by then and I felt that this was one hell of a journey I had while writing one. Like a trip to a world from where I didn''t want to come back. I was free; to feel, do and say whatever I wanted to. It was beautiful and liberating with the right people. My creations were no less than people.\r\n\r\nHowever, this did include a big deal of mental dilemma, literary complications and ups and downs. Writing something is not a piece of cake, I assure you. You have to pick the right words. You can''t write something and turn it into something else. You have to know what you want and how you intend to go about it. You can''t lose track and then come back to write any nonsense just to make it a part of the work. It should make some sense.\r\n\r\n<img src="https://dkzstslcvgwbc.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/resize/inline_image/hotguy-443x295.jpg" alt="" />\r\n\r\nWell, enough said, I snapped back to reality as I realized that the story was now nearing the climax. That''s what broke my heart. This had to end anyway. Sooner or later. They were going away from me. Yet another family was going to be preserved in the pages of my diary. Another lesson and wonderful experience with memories to cherish. Like a part of myself had latched onto those people I talked to but never seen. The pain ripped me apart. Into a million pieces.\r\n\r\nMaybe what Stephen King said was right after all.\r\n\r\n"JK Rowling created seven <em>Horcruxes</em>. She put a part of her soul in every book and now her books will live forever"\r\n\r\nI guess I did the same. But it was painful enough with just one story.\r\n\r\nThe essence of a story is different when it''s complete. It''s captivating. I could go on reading mine for hours and hours but not get bored. To make myself believe that the pain would subside and lie to my heart that it wasn''t over.\r\n\r\nA completed story is a wonder to behold.\r\n\r\n<strong>A beautiful heartbreak.</strong>', 'The beautiful heartbreak', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-beautiful-heartbreak', '', '', '2015-06-10 20:21:39', '2015-06-10 14:51:39', '', 0, 'http://blog.thebookhub.in/?p=229', 0, 'post', '', 0);

Simply out of curiosity. The child answered, “What is a m..mile..milestone?” The teacher smiled and explained, “A milestone is an important event in someone’s life. Like when you turn ten years old or when you go to college!” The child thought for a minute and said, “My dad got me my first basketball yesterday. I think that was an important event in my life.”\r\n\r\nA son asked his father, what to him was his life’s most cherished milestone. “There are many”, the father said, “but the day I married your mother has been my most favourite ever since.”\r\n\r\nA friend asked her 38-year old, National Award winning Kathak teacher, what her single most important milestone in life was. She said, “I beat Cancer. Twice.”\r\n\r\nMy sister told me a few days ago that I must go out for drinks with her whenever I would visit her next. I asked her if she would be willing to look out for me if I went about hurling everywhere after. “Yes!”, she said. “Those are milestones too.”\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/images1111.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-241 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/images1111.jpg" alt="images111" width="276" height="183" /></a>\r\n\r\nEach of us, no matter how old we are or where we come from, has a list of things that we might have achieved or are hopeful about achieving. When we strike out some things off that list, we call them milestones- things that remind us how far we have come, the things we witnessed on the way, the sacrifices we made to get where we are, and all that lies ahead.\r\n\r\nOne year is a long time. 365 days, 8,760 hours, 52,56,000 minutes and 3,15,36,000 seconds. Every moment is a new memory made. Every breath, every step, every sigh, every thought, every blink of the eye, every sight- is unique in its own way. When we put these elements in a string together, the multidimensional image of our one by gone year emerges.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/images-6.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-239 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/images-6.jpg" alt="images (6)" width="275" height="183" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne year since you found your soul mate, one year since you got that car you had been saving all your life for, one year since you took that trip with your best friends, one year since your brother started attending school, one year since your dog passed away after having lived a long and healthy life, one year since your twins turned one, one year since that house got burned down, one year since you moved to a new continent, one year since you made a million new memories, since you shed a few tears, since you laughed so hard you could feel the pressure in your head- one year since you lived.\r\n\r\nThe past year has been special to the team of The Book Hub too. I asked the Owner-Developer to tell me how it all started. He said, “<em>Main bore ho raha tha. Mere paas bohot saari e-books padi thien. Sabko ek jagah upload kiya aur chaar pages ki website bana daali!</em>” (When I started out, I only did it to avoid getting bored. I had a lot of e-books, so I uploaded them at one place and created a four-page long website.) I was amazed, and to be honest, slightly disappointed. I was looking for something more solid, deep and meaningful behind the making of this website. And all I was given was “<em>boriyat</em>” (boredom). This was exactly when it struck me that we keep waiting for good things to shape up amidst much pomp and show while forgetting to realise that “life is what happens to us when we are busy making plans”, that life’s most magnificent pleasures are hidden away in the simplest folds of its fabric.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/images-7.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-238 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/images-7.jpg" alt="images (7)" width="267" height="189" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe Book Hub began with a handful of college-going kids, brought together by the shared passion for books and a deep-seated interest in technology. And here we are- 365 days, 15,000 visitors (and counting) and with an outreach to over 20 countries later- celebrating our first milestone; growing slowly, yet steadily. So imperative and valuable are these events- those that have kept so many of us going; that gave us a reason to start afresh, to keep trying our hands at what we want to do, to bridge the gap between where we are and where we want to be, to believe in the miracle that is human life.\r\n\r\nI am reminded of something Shri Shri Ranbir Kapoorji said in one of his motion pictures that aids my purpose here, “<em>Kahin par pohonchane ke liye, kahin se nikalna bohot zaroori hota hai!</em>” (In order to get somewhere, it is necessary that we get away from somewhere!). Rightfully so. How do we plan on achieving another milestone otherwise, right?\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-237 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2-300x206.jpg" alt="2" width="300" height="206" /></a>\r\n<p style="text-align: center">Well, we turned one today and it is almost surreal.

Who handled Snape’s wrath because if Lord Voldemort had gone for him, Lily would’ve survived? Who had his parents tortured to insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and the damage was so strong his mother didn’t recognize him and he lived in burning hell everyday knowing that he would never have the same connection with them that he had before? We may not accept it but living a life knowing your parents don’t know you is a fate worse than being dead. Sorry Harry but at least you know your parents would know you if they were alive. Neville Longbottom has our sympathy here *I don’t mean to be rude people* Let’s give it up to Neville’s true Gryffindor personality!\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville1.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville1-300x155.jpg" alt="hp-neville" width="300" height="155" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-92" /></a>\r\n\r\nNevilleLongbottom is that one important character who literally determines the whole course of series. He could’ve easily been ‘The Chosen One’, allowing Harry to be a normal wizard boy on ‘The Hogwarts Express’ without a scar, sitting with other kids, laughing without worries. But destiny had different plans for him. He did land up with scars, psychological ones, a little more painful than Harry’s. He has quite a lot of followers and fans in the fandom and who can blame him?\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/download.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/download.jpg" alt="download" width="194" height="260" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84" /></a>\r\n\r\nNot to forget his excruciatingly painful and good looks, he’s got the soul and qualities of a true Gryffindor – humility, nobility, kindness, loyalty, fierce supportiveness and bravery. Neville is a crystal clear reflection of the ‘real-life- Gryffindors, who have a potential to be true heroes under the most dangerous and life threatening situations, but not be a ‘Superman’ while sleeping and waking up. He clearly understands that being a person isn’t about being ‘the one’ who is always noticed no matter where they go and thrashing up villains at every freaking chance they get (No offence Harry, but Neville has his own points and you know it), it’s about deciding your battles and know what’s close enough to your heart and worth fighting for. \r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville3.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville3-300x168.jpg" alt="hp-neville3" width="300" height="168" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-85" /></a>\r\n\r\nNeville could’ve easily gotten Harry’s life by a span of one SINGLE DAY, has Voldemort seen him as a ‘real threat’ and let Harry live a little more normally.\r\nNow if we try to clearly dig into a little research, J K. Rowling has actually drawn Neville’s character from someone parallel in the previous generation: The Marauders. She did this with a lot of thinking, taking into account other characters. Neville is (please don’t kill ME) Peter Pettigrew. Okay! I’ll take the hurl of swear words till your actually understand why this was observed. He is the one who usually tags along with the trio but is looked down upon by everyone as he’s not remarkably talented or suave. He’s like the priest who knows every one of Harry’s most important secrets and could easily spill the beans. But then AGAIN! He’s a truly loyal Gryffindor! In addition, Professor McGonagall calls Peter Pettigrew ‘foolish boy’. Just like him Neville is another pureblood who has technically no respect from the notable wizarding families. Neville is the kid everyone picks on when Harry, Ron and Hermione aren’t around to defend him; gullible and the easy mark. He could’ve been Peter’s brand new analog in the story. \r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-peter.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-peter-300x164.jpg" alt="hp-peter" width="300" height="164" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-86" /></a>\r\n\r\nReason being – he can either ruin a dish or make it the epitome of perfection. He’s the game changer, tide turner and the shiny hinge. (whatever you want to call him) Apart from this, he’s in the same position as Wormtail, who made all the hard choices Wormtail didn’t. Of all the characters, Neville is the only one who goes the furthest to prove that an individual’s destiny is in his hands.  He of course, possesses other characteristics worth talking about, other than his own. What is important here is how his strengths fill in group dynamics needed by the Marauders. He’s wanted by the trio the same way Lily, James and the Order of Phoenix wanted Peter. Just that Neville is more than upto the task.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville2.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville2-300x161.jpg" alt="hp-neville2" width="300" height="161" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-87" /></a> \r\n\r\nNeville teaches us a lesson in self-worth and shows us that having a strong personality doesn''t always mean that  you''re meant to lead people and will only make the right decisions. Society at large only sees the leaders and their closest friends are dismissed at the first glance, pretty much like Neville was dismissed by his classmates in the first year. However, he doesn’t let his peers’ attitude affect him enough to give up. Instead, over the years. His self-depreciation turns into persistent desire to improve and increase his skill set on offering help irrespective of its need and he figures out how he can best come of use in a fight.\r\nHis very first act of heroism is seen in ‘Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone’ when he stands up to Harry, Ron and Hermione, becoming a victim to Hermione’s full ‘Body Bind’ curse which gives him enough points for Gryffindor to win the house Cup. He personally makes sure to announce Neville’s name at the last so as to make Neville proud of his bravery to stand up against his friends when he was right. (given that Dumbledore was actually scared that history would repeat itself and he was more than relieved that Neville chose a different road) Immediately after that incident, he avoids falling into Peter’s shoes by stepping away a little from the trio so that it showed people that his meekness isn’t a signal for people to mess around with him.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images-3.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images-3.jpg" alt="images (3)" width="276" height="183" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-94" /></a>\r\n\r\nHe’s the defender, the keeper of hope and a true friend. When Harry publicly claims to see Lord Voldemort in the fourth year, the world speculates and calls him a liar, making a mockery out of him. Neville however, sticks to his side and believes him, fighting with him unlike most who run away and pee in their pants when real danger comes. He keeps the alive the ‘Dumbledore’s Army’ in Hogwarts despite Harry’s absence. He assumes the leader’s role, which was the hardest job anyone could do given Snape was the Headmaster during that time and builds a refuge in the ‘Room of Requirement’. Despite witnessing the murders, tortures and kidnappings of his closest friends, he stays hopeful in the castle, hopefully waiting for Harry, Ron and Hermione to return. He’s the PRIME FACTOR for the ‘Battle of Hogwarts’ to take place. We can’t deny he was the spark that set the castle on fire. \r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville5.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville5-300x159.jpg" alt="hp-neville5" width="300" height="159" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-89" /></a>\r\n\r\nLeaving all this aside, Neville doesn’t fail his parents as the perfect son. Neville’s bravery, strength and love for his family keeps him fighting on for them even though they’re no longer there. He makes it his goal to be that ideal son though his parents would never know of his feats, deeds and mark in the wizarding world. \r\nIn the final hour, fate is about to make history repeat itself when he’s given the same cowardly choice of joining Voldemort and taking the easy way out. He changes the game at that very moment by drawing the sword of Gryffindor out of the burning Sorting Hat and slicing off Nagini’s head, ending Voldemort’s life. This moment proves that Harry needs Neville just the way he needs Ron and Hermione to end the war and put a cork in the bottle. It all comes down to Neville – the boy who demanded respect from his friends at the very start no matter how he felt and he chose to do what was right because it was the hardest thing to do.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/downloadii.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/downloadii.jpg" alt="downloadii" width="271" height="186" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-93" /></a>\r\n\r\nNow that we actually observe Neville under a whole new light, we discover that he’s indeed, the truest of Gryffindors and balances the entire HP narrative. Which makes us think – what would’ve Peter Pettigrew been like if he had known that courage wasn’t about following blindly following someone but about choosing to do what was right even when nobody asked that of you. He taught us that in this huge world filled with people who blend in easily with the crowd  and are followed because they’re known, there are some people who may seem different and ‘out of place’ but sometimes, THEY are the ones who lead the world to a better future……\r\nHere are 3 whole pages, OUR tribute to the truest Gryffindor – Neville Longbottom ‘The Boy who Could’ve Been’ and ‘The Boy who Made History’\r\n#SaluteToNevilleLongbottom !\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images-4.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images-4.jpg" alt="images (4)" width="184" height="273" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-95" /></a>\r\n', 'The Game changer and truest Gryffindor', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '91-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-04-11 19:19:03', '2015-04-11 13:49:03', '', 91, 'http://blog.thebookhub.in/91-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

A good book is the ultimate muse for a reader.\r\n\r\nSuch is their magic. Those stacks of pages filled with stories, experiences and tales in attractive covers are like gateways to a beautiful world of imagination where anyone can be what they want without being judged, mocked or instructed. An alternate universe into which eager readers slip to find themselves in the exotic worlds of their abstract minds.\r\n\r\nIt all starts with turning the first page of that treasure trove of indelible expressions: narration and connection which holds the reader close and engages the mind into an unforgettable literary adventure. The feel of a new book, smell of fresh pages, color of a new front cover and sight of the title to a reader is like a flower to a honeybee. Words wait to cast their spell on people. The ultimate fantasy of any reader is to either own an unbelievably big library at some point in their lives or sit in one corner of anywhere with a beverage, munchies and a good book.\r\n\r\nBooks have come a long way from illustrations, journals, autobiographies, testimonies, novels and who knows where this might all go. Reading is like a therapy and a good book is a vacation you need if you really want a break without troubling your pockets. Bonus points of reading – good reading habits, richer vocabulary with a better understanding of the language,  healthy mind exercise, getting a better chance to understand what the readers want and more knowledge.\r\n\r\nQuoting the iconic J.K. Rowling, “I don’t believe in magic. But words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic.” We really can’t argue with that now, can we?\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/book-2.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/book-2.jpg" alt="book 2" width="290" height="174" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-69" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe also know authors and writers who have spun magic with their words over the decades. To name a few renowned literary legends, there’s Jeffrey Archer, Dan Brown,  J. K. Rowling ( again), Ruskin Bond, Ayn Rand and Daniel Defoe.  Now let’s talk about the most common mistake we often make as readers – confusing writers with authors. Authors are the ones who create and invent plots and are the originators of ideas. Writers are the ones focusing on one idea and modifying it to suit their storyline. It’s more like a sub-class of the main class.\r\nTo add to it, books are like best friends – they never leave you no matter what. Reading a book is like preparing yourself to be strapped to a roller-coaster of emotions. It’s like reading an untold life story, discovering an exotic land, unraveling a mystery, knowing an unshared experience. It’s not always easy to pick up a book, but once you do it, it’s pretty much worth it. Also, reading books may have one of these outcomes (maybe even multiple):\r\n•	Sometimes, the story leaves such an impression on your life, your mind just hangs in there and ponders over what you just read. Great stories rarely come by and when that happens, it’ll be days before the reader’s mind is fresh enough to go on another literary adventure.\r\n•	Chances are the writer has taken a good idea and not done such a good job elaborating on it (Let’s face it! Everyone’s not good with ideas and expression). However, one bad book can help potential writers understand the Do’s and Don’ts of producing some real good reading material.\r\n•	At times, the engaging factors for the reader are the characters, their personalities and the way they handle the world. Intimate connection with characters is a common occurrence and this may result in them playing a big role to mould the reader into a person. So, yeah you could say the readers are in a big way affected by what kind of stories they read.\r\n•	This clause may be fatal if one is a hard-core reader (chuckles softly): Some books often have characters and storylines that are somehow deeply connected with how the real world is. The reader develops a strong affection for the characters and more than often sees them as a second family. They can relate to the fictional individuals and try to understand the situation they are in. This way, the story becomes an integral part of the reader’s life, giving him/her life lessons, countless memories and in some cases, a childhood. \r\n•	Books also have a big role in determining how the reader might end up looking at the world and behave accordingly. This you could say, is something like ‘temporary inspiration’. The plot could be so overpowering that for some time the reader could actually try and imitate the fictional individuals expecting the same outcome as in the book. Books, as we don’t usually expect, have a technical aspect too. They’re more than just words and language; intricately linked with our lives and understanding of what’s happening around us.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/books.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/books.jpg" alt="books" width="274" height="184" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-61" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe best part about them is – they don’t manipulate you. It’s a free world where you can venture off wherever your heart and mind lead you. A world which you can carry along with you everywhere. ‘Books are knowledge’ isn’t a fashion statement. It’s pretty much valid because some of them are authored or written by people who actually cement their storyline with some research to blend in fiction and reality. It’s like taking the reader on an imaginary tour yet keeping him within the real world. We can’t even say it’s not true.\r\n\r\nAlso, books are a more intimate form of expression since time immemorial. Over here, I’m actually talking about the hard-copies. There’s a strange love that only a true book-lover can understand when one gets to touch the book in all its dimensions. Technology and e-books can never replace real books that way. Tactility is something that helps the reader build a connection with what he’s about to read, according to psychological studies, it stimulates his curiosity as humans respond and react mostly to touch. \r\n\r\nBooks also have a crucial role in forming a person’s mindset. For instance: a person indulging way too often in fiction may end up being way too imaginative and mentally immature. Romance novels often make the reader develop the notion that love is a beautiful feeling (which it is, no doubt) but they may also cause the reader that love stories have a perfectly happy ending as usually portrayed in books. It could cause the person to mistake ‘like’ for ‘love’ and fall in love with the ‘concept of love’. It is amazing no doubt but one should always balance out the proportion in which he/she reads every genre, that’s the moral. (All said from personal experience)\r\n\r\nAlso, most importantly, books are an invaluable medium of communication. Talking and reaching out to people, sending across your views, opinions, stories and ideas with feedback in the form of critic’s review and the readership.  Apart from this, when people read, it surely raises some questions, which makes them interact with others who have read the same book.

To name a few renowned literary legends, there’s Jeffrey Archer, Dan Brown,  J. K. Rowling ( again), Ruskin Bond, Ayn Rand and Daniel Defoe.  Now let’s talk about the most common mistake we often make as readers – confusing writers with authors. Authors are the ones who create and invent plots and are the originators of ideas. Writers are the ones focusing on one idea and modifying it to suit their storyline. It’s more like a sub-class of the main class.\r\nTo add to it, books are like best friends – they never leave you no matter what. Reading a book is like preparing yourself to be strapped to a roller-coaster of emotions. It’s like reading an untold life story, discovering an exotic land, unraveling a mystery, knowing an unshared experience. It’s not always easy to pick up a book, but once you do it, it’s pretty much worth it. Also, reading books may have one of these outcomes (maybe even multiple):\r\n•	Sometimes, the story leaves such an impression on your life, your mind just hangs in there and ponders over what you just read. Great stories rarely come by and when that happens, it’ll be days before the reader’s mind is fresh enough to go on another literary adventure.\r\n•	Chances are the writer has taken a good idea and not done such a good job elaborating on it (Let’s face it! Everyone’s not good with ideas and expression). However, one bad book can help potential writers understand the Do’s and Don’ts of producing some real good reading material.\r\n•	At times, the engaging factors for the reader are the characters, their personalities and the way they handle the world. Intimate connection with characters is a common occurrence and this may result in them playing a big role to mould the reader into a person. So, yeah you could say the readers are in a big way affected by what kind of stories they read.\r\n•	This clause may be fatal if one is a hard-core reader (chuckles softly): Some books often have characters and storylines that are somehow deeply connected with how the real world is. The reader develops a strong affection for the characters and more than often sees them as a second family. They can relate to the fictional individuals and try to understand the situation they are in. This way, the story becomes an integral part of the reader’s life, giving him/her life lessons, countless memories and in some cases, a childhood. \r\n•	Books also have a big role in determining how the reader might end up looking at the world and behave accordingly. This you could say, is something like ‘temporary inspiration’. The plot could be so overpowering that for some time the reader could actually try and imitate the fictional individuals expecting the same outcome as in the book. Books, as we don’t usually expect, have a technical aspect too. They’re more than just words and language; intricately linked with our lives and understanding of what’s happening around us.\r\nThe best part about them is – they don’t manipulate you. It’s a free world where you can venture off wherever your heart and mind lead you. A world which you can carry along with you everywhere. ‘Books are knowledge’ isn’t a fashion statement. It’s pretty much valid because some of them are authored or written by people who actually cement their storyline with some research to blend in fiction and reality. It’s like taking the reader on an imaginary tour yet keeping him within the real world. We can’t even say it’s not true.\r\nAlso, books are a more intimate form of expression since time immemorial. Over here, I’m actually talking about the hard-copies. There’s a strange love that only a true book-lover can understand when one gets to touch the book in all its dimensions. Technology and e-books can never replace real books that way. Tactility is something that helps the reader build a connection with what he’s about to read, according to psychological studies, it stimulates his curiosity as humans respond and react mostly to touch. \r\nBooks also have a crucial role in forming a person’s mindset. For instance: a person indulging way too often in fiction may end up being way too imaginative and mentally immature. Romance novels often make the reader develop the notion that love is a beautiful feeling (which it is, no doubt) but they may also cause the reader that love stories have a perfectly happy ending as usually portrayed in books. It could cause the person to mistake ‘like’ for ‘love’ and fall in love with the ‘concept of love’. It is amazing no doubt but one should always balance out the proportion in which he/she reads every genre, that’s the moral. (All said from personal experience)\r\nAlso, most importantly, books are an invaluable medium of communication. Talking and reaching out to people, sending across your views, opinions, stories and ideas with feedback in the form of critic’s review and the readership.  Apart from this, when people read, it surely raises some questions, which makes them interact with others who have read the same book. Interaction leads to bonding and it goes on.\r\nLooking at all this, we could reiterate the fact that books have more than just one aspect; social, personal, psychological and technical. An in-depth understanding of everything above would help us realize exactly how important are books in our lives. \r\nFor these very reasons, books are invaluable treasures for mankind that not only need to be preserved but also promoted, loved and respected.

Intimate connection with characters is a common occurrence and this may result in them playing a big role to mould the reader into a person. So, yeah you could say the readers are in a big way affected by what kind of stories they read.\r\n•	This clause may be fatal if one is a hard-core reader (chuckles softly): Some books often have characters and storylines that are somehow deeply connected with how the real world is. The reader develops a strong affection for the characters and more than often sees them as a second family.

rnet-crazed world, attention is drawn in a million different directions at once as we multi-task throughout the day. But when a person reads a book of his interest, his entire attention is focused just on the story - the rest of the world just falls away, and the reader immerses in every fine detail he is absorbing. One should try reading for 15-20 minutes every day before starting his daily activities and he’ll be surprised at the increased amount of focus he’s able to give to all activities he involves himself in.</p>\r\n<p>At last, it is clear that reading transforms a person into someone entirely different. The icing on the cake, all these benefits come for free! Sure some of us buy books, but most books are available either for free or at meager costs at local libraries, or on the Internet. There’s a genre for every literate person on our planet, and whether your taste lies in classical literature, poetry, fashion magazines, religious texts, biographies, young adult books or romantic novels, there’s something out there to capture your curiosity and imagination. So step away from meaningless activities for a little while, crack open a book or an e-book, and replenish your soul for a little while.</p>\r\n',

You could just push them into a room full of books or a library and never expect them to come out. A nice cup of coffee and a quiet place is all they need to fulfill their wishes. Gift them books to win their hearts or make their birthdays perfect. The way we feel about books is the way Belle is ‘Beauty and the Beast’ reacts when the Beast shows her the library. Funny but true. The smell of the new pages and the ones that are ancient with age; it’s like a harmless drug for readers. A million stories that spark off our imagination and apart from imparting education, they help us to discover the fact that words may be just mundane like other things to many people but for us, they’re like beautiful galaxies woven and spun together to form a flawlessly stunning universe. \r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images-1.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images-1.jpg" alt="images (1)" width="194" height="259" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-125" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere are words for every genre – that’s their beauty. There’s something for everything. Technology may be a boon to mankind and you could say it’s a blessing for those who don’t like carrying books around in their bags and take the care of maintaining them, but then every coin has a flip side: the screen of ‘Kindle’ could crack for all you know, one click of a button and you could just lose your opportunity of reading. You could drop them and damage them. E-books stored on laptops and computers; they have a chance of getting lost with the hard-drive crash or any technological glitch for that matter. Handling them with care is another clause that comes with technological products. Not to forget the strain on your eyes when you keep staring at a screen for hours while reading and then comes along another problem – ‘Kindle’ runs on battery that can expire or run out of charge or even get damaged. Without the battery, ‘Kindle’ is basically a box with books that can’t be accessed. Books, you can carry them anywhere, anytime in any condition; no worries of the ‘Kindle’ not being able to withstand extreme temperatures. Books, you fix them up with tape, put some classic binding and glue them up; all at a reasonable cost. No need to go to a technician and spend a thousand bucks and wait for days to just read a few books!!  I mean c’mon! Paper is so much better than pixels!\r\n1.	True ownership of a book:\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images-300x168.jpg" alt="images" width="300" height="168" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-126" /></a>\r\n\r\nIt’s true that you can own a book and an ‘e-book’. But even the ownership is different in nature. Book makes you have a feel of the ‘physical ownership’, in hard-copy. It becomes a part of yourself. You can hug it and go to sleep. Sit peacefully on a beach, reading a book, with the waves kissing your body and receding, no worries of dropping your book in the water and losing it because the water seeped into the hardware and destroyed it. It’s your constant companion. Scribble notes and ideas, literally and symbolically mark your territory over it. The highlights and markings are one aspect. Then comes the interaction and engaging process with the book.\r\n The plus point – there are visible marks that you’ve bonded with your book. Only if you have a proper book, will people ever know you’ve read it; or anyone else for that matter. You see bent and ‘dog-eared’ pages, a shaking and loose book spine, signs of age and use. People will come to know that the reader has been impacted by the book, the story has had an effect on their lives. On the other hand, send an e-book to someone else; if you get it back, you’ll see the highlights and notes gone, because that’s just how technology is. The ownership belongs to you or your device, not to the book. Last but not the least, when you often to go to a library and see an old book, flip through its pages. See the notes and ideas written over the pages. You’ll get an idea of what kind of experiences different people had with the book and how it has made a mark on those lives. This can never be reproduced in an e-book format.\r\n\r\n2.	Loan  a Book:\r\nYou ask me why I hate e-books; they CAN’T be loaned! They have some kind of digital rights management involved which bonds a book to a particular owner. On buying a Kindle book, you could have a copy of it on your device but then again! There comes the system of linking the devices with various accounts. It’s all painful technological processes everywhere just to give yourself the pleasure of reading a great story. In case of books, you can loan one or two or any number. That’s the best – anywhere, any way, any time and how much ever. In case of Kindle, you have to loan your entire reading device; basically, either you loan everything or nothing at all. Then again, even if an e-book doesn’t have any digital management rights, loaning it is very different from actual loaning. It’s actually ‘duplicating’ a book. When you loan someone a book, they actually witness your experience with it. There’s a level of trust, intimacy and shared experience in loaning books which can’t be found in electronic books.\r\n\r\n3.	A single tasking device. \r\nA book is inherently opposed to multi-tasking. Not more than one or two tasks can be performed while reading it. This indirectly implies that a reader can devote nearly 90% of his attention to the story that he/she is reading. No distraction, no problem.  This allows the reader to have the best possible reading experience and actually enjoy it. E-books on the other hand, are technological devices crafted in such a way that multi-tasking is made possible. Stored in I-Pads or anything else for that matter, e-books contain hyper-links and built-in dictionary and many other applications somehow related to reading which drive the reader away from the wholesome reading experience. They buzz, beep and disengage the reader in many ways.\r\n\r\n4.	One can buy a used book.\r\nWalk down a street and see if you can see even a single e-book store as compared to outlets selling used books. E-books can never be USED, let’s face it. They stay cold, unblemished and untouched but only duplicated for years to come. Their prices never change, they can never be dug out of boxes like long lost treasure and never suddenly turn up like unexpected old gifts from us to us. They can never be loaned or resold. They stay fresh, unused and forever sustained. There are NO  rare first editions or special editions. A used book will be a vestige of the past but irreplaceable and vintage.\r\n\r\nBecause books are the BEST inventions till date!\r\n', 'Why books will always be magical', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'why-books-will-always-be-magical', '', '', '2015-04-18 23:44:40', '2015-04-18 18:14:40', '', 0, 'http://blog.thebookhub.in/?p=123', 0, 'post', '', 1);

Who had his parents tortured to insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and the damage was so strong his mother didn’t recognize him and he lived in burning hell everyday knowing that he would never have the same connection with them that he had before? We may not accept it but living a life knowing your parents don’t know you is a fate worse than being dead. Sorry Harry but at least you know your parents would know you if they were alive. Neville Longbottom has our sympathy here *I don’t mean to be rude people* Let’s give it up to Neville’s true Gryffindor personality!\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville1.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville1-300x155.jpg" alt="hp-neville" width="300" height="155" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-92" /></a>\r\n\r\nNevilleLongbottom is that one important character who literally determines the whole course of series. He could’ve easily been ‘The Chosen One’, allowing Harry to be a normal wizard boy on ‘The Hogwarts Express’ without a scar, sitting with other kids, laughing without worries. But destiny had different plans for him. He did land up with scars, psychological ones, a little more painful than Harry’s. He has quite a lot of followers and fans in the fandom and who can blame him?\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/download.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/download.jpg" alt="download" width="194" height="260" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84" /></a>\r\n\r\nNot to forget his excruciatingly painful and good looks, he’s got the soul and qualities of a true Gryffindor – humility, nobility, kindness, loyalty, fierce supportiveness and bravery. Neville is a crystal clear reflection of the ‘real-life- Gryffindors, who have a potential to be true heroes under the most dangerous and life threatening situations, but not be a ‘Superman’ while sleeping and waking up. He clearly understands that being a person isn’t about being ‘the one’ who is always noticed no matter where they go and thrashing up villains at every freaking chance they get (No offence Harry, but Neville has his own points and you know it), it’s about deciding your battles and know what’s close enough to your heart and worth fighting for. \r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville3.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville3-300x168.jpg" alt="hp-neville3" width="300" height="168" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-85" /></a>\r\n\r\nNeville could’ve easily gotten Harry’s life by a span of one SINGLE DAY, has Voldemort seen him as a ‘real threat’ and let Harry live a little more normally.\r\nNow if we try to clearly dig into a little research, J K. Rowling has actually drawn Neville’s character from someone parallel in the previous generation: The Marauders. She did this with a lot of thinking, taking into account other characters. Neville is (please don’t kill ME) Peter Pettigrew. Okay! I’ll take the hurl of swear words till your actually understand why this was observed. He is the one who usually tags along with the trio but is looked down upon by everyone as he’s not remarkably talented or suave. He’s like the priest who knows every one of Harry’s most important secrets and could easily spill the beans. But then AGAIN! He’s a truly loyal Gryffindor! In addition, Professor McGonagall calls Peter Pettigrew ‘foolish boy’. Just like him Neville is another pureblood who has technically no respect from the notable wizarding families. Neville is the kid everyone picks on when Harry, Ron and Hermione aren’t around to defend him; gullible and the easy mark. He could’ve been Peter’s brand new analog in the story. \r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-peter.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-peter-300x164.jpg" alt="hp-peter" width="300" height="164" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-86" /></a>\r\n\r\nReason being – he can either ruin a dish or make it the epitome of perfection. He’s the game changer, tide turner and the shiny hinge. (whatever you want to call him) Apart from this, he’s in the same position as Wormtail, who made all the hard choices Wormtail didn’t. Of all the characters, Neville is the only one who goes the furthest to prove that an individual’s destiny is in his hands.  He of course, possesses other characteristics worth talking about, other than his own. What is important here is how his strengths fill in group dynamics needed by the Marauders. He’s wanted by the trio the same way Lily, James and the Order of Phoenix wanted Peter. Just that Neville is more than upto the task.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville2.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville2-300x161.jpg" alt="hp-neville2" width="300" height="161" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-87" /></a> \r\n\r\nNeville teaches us a lesson in self-worth and shows us that having a strong personality doesn''t always mean that  you''re meant to lead people and will only make the right decisions.

Neville is a crystal clear reflection of the ‘real-life- Gryffindors, who have a potential to be true heroes under the most dangerous and life threatening situations, but not be a ‘Superman’ while sleeping and waking up. He clearly understands that being a person isn’t about being ‘the one’ who is always noticed no matter where they go and thrashing up villains at every freaking chance they get (No offence Harry, but Neville has his own points and you know it), it’s about deciding your battles and know what’s close enough to your heart and worth fighting for. \r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville3.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville3-300x168.jpg" alt="hp-neville3" width="300" height="168" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-85" /></a>\r\n\r\nNeville could’ve easily gotten Harry’s life by a span of one SINGLE DAY, has Voldemort seen him as a ‘real threat’ and let Harry live a little more normally.\r\nNow if we try to clearly dig into a little research, J K. Rowling has actually drawn Neville’s character from someone parallel in the previous generation: The Marauders. She did this with a lot of thinking, taking into account other characters. Neville is (please don’t kill ME) Peter Pettigrew. Okay! I’ll take the hurl of swear words till your actually understand why this was observed. He is the one who usually tags along with the trio but is looked down upon by everyone as he’s not remarkably talented or suave. He’s like the priest who knows every one of Harry’s most important secrets and could easily spill the beans. But then AGAIN! He’s a truly loyal Gryffindor! In addition, Professor McGonagall calls Peter Pettigrew ‘foolish boy’. Just like him Neville is another pureblood who has technically no respect from the notable wizarding families. Neville is the kid everyone picks on when Harry, Ron and Hermione aren’t around to defend him; gullible and the easy mark. He could’ve been Peter’s brand new analog in the story. \r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-peter.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-peter-300x164.jpg" alt="hp-peter" width="300" height="164" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-86" /></a>\r\n\r\nReason being – he can either ruin a dish or make it the epitome of perfection. He’s the game changer, tide turner and the shiny hinge. (whatever you want to call him) Apart from this, he’s in the same position as Wormtail, who made all the hard choices Wormtail didn’t. Of all the characters, Neville is the only one who goes the furthest to prove that an individual’s destiny is in his hands.  He of course, possesses other characteristics worth talking about, other than his own. What is important here is how his strengths fill in group dynamics needed by the Marauders. He’s wanted by the trio the same way Lily, James and the Order of Phoenix wanted Peter. Just that Neville is more than upto the task.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville2.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville2-300x161.jpg" alt="hp-neville2" width="300" height="161" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-87" /></a> \r\n\r\nNeville teaches us a lesson in self-worth other than having a strong personality.

But I would pay no heed to them. Basically, Bollywood had ruined me forever!\n\nI am certain that most of those who are reading this must, at some point or the other, have had similar dreams. Vague, impractical, distorted images of our future selves, fashioned from the cameras of impassioned daydreaming. Bursting our bubble, however, reality did to our larger-than-life ideas what a flame does to a moth. At every step, the impediments grew mightier.\n\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/download.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-166 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/download.jpg" alt="download" width="456" height="303" /></a>\nMoving to a metropolitan city turns one’s life around. Meeting new people, engaging oneself in dialogue and discussions, looking after oneself because no one else will- opens our eyes to the real world, marking a departure from our utopian wonderlands. A world where no matter how good one might think they are, they will always find an equal, if not better, match. A place where one realises that they will soon be expected to shoulder serious responsibilities, to get one’s life together and to prove one’s mettle while they are at it. A place where a line of distinction is drawn between being well-trained and being well educated; where one finally comes to realise that test scores are really just numbers, that often prove to be an insufficient and unjust parameter to judge a person’s true calibre. All this, if one does not lose their sanity amidst the bright lights and deafening noise, of course.\n\nThe flip side has a different story to tell. For someone who has led a simplistic lifestyle, the fast-paced atmosphere of an urban setting can be scary to cope up with. For them, the competition is too fierce, the pressure too high, the voices too loud, the choices too extreme, the expectations too burdensome and life too twisted. They often lose themselves in the search of things that are far beyond their reach.\n\nHaving lived in a metropolitan for about two years, makes me wonder, like anyone else, as to where my life is headed. While big cities offer varied opportunities, they also baffle young minds. A hundred different people narrating a hundred different versions of a strange tale-what to do and what not to do. Enveloped in such surroundings, it can be difficult to hold on to one’s ground. But amidst all this, there is an invisible force drawing us back to the city. The city which teaches one that none will ever know them the way they know themselves, and that they may never know someone else too well either; the city that encourages one to embrace challenges and take risks; that which pushes one to stand right back up after every fall; that which reminds one how people come and go but the only thing they can constantly hold onto is, the self- mind and soul intact; that which trains one to believe, and to never underestimate the wonders of honest hard work. This city- your city- ensures that YOU never give up.\n\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Mumbai_Skyline_at_Night.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-167 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Mumbai_Skyline_at_Night-300x148.jpg" alt="Mumbai_Skyline_at_Night" width="448" height="221" /></a>\nAs a student, it is not hard for me to imagine how much one can miss being home, how empty life can seem without good friends at one’s immediate disposal, how lonely one can get in big groups, how comforting it is to sit among family cradled in all of the universe’s love and affection and how satisfying <em>maa ke haath ka khaana</em> can taste. But if you ask me, I will tell you that there is a calling within each of us that makes us miss the city life, makes us want to go back. Because, yes, home will always be home; and <em>ghar ka khaana</em> is irreplaceable; and playing Holi with college friends and colleagues will never be as much fun as playing with kids in the colony; but none of this is the key to the future of our dreams. The city is. The inclination towards being independent is not something one can easily give up. We all like being less answerable, we all appreciate our privacy and space being respected. So when one sets their heart to conquering a milestone, they make their peace with distances, inconveniences and memories. After all, home is where the heart is.\n\nIn retrospection, one may eventually come to terms with the fact that they may not be the same person they were three years ago. That they now understand better, analyse better and can take. One’s problems have escalated from acquiring permission to watch a movie with friends to persistently fighting the dedicated battle against losing oneself in the crowd. Priorities have changed from buying that SUV to sending one’s parents on a holiday that they rightfully deserve. Realisation dawns upon us kids that we probably are our own superheroes. And the city plays a pivotal role in teaching us this.\n\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/looking-at-sky.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-168 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/looking-at-sky-300x216.jpg" alt="looking-at-sky" width="378" height="272" /></a>\n<p style="text-align: center">Growing up may not have been the best thing that happened to us, but the city sure made it one hell of a ride!</p>\n<p style="text-align: center"></p>', 'The City', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '165-autosave-v1', '', '', '2015-05-13 14:25:15', '2015-05-13 08:55:15', '', 165, 'http://blog.thebookhub.in/165-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

He taught us that in this huge world filled with people who blend in easily with the crowd  and are followed because they’re known, there are some people who may seem different and ‘out of place’ but sometimes, THEY are the ones who lead the world to a better future……\r\nHere are 3 whole pages, OUR tribute to the truest Gryffindor – Neville Longbottom ‘The Boy who Could’ve Been’ and ‘The Boy who Made History’\r\n#SaluteToNevilleLongbottom !\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images-4.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images-4.jpg" alt="images (4)" width="184" height="273" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-95" /></a>\r\n', 'The Game changer and truest Gryffindor', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '91-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-04-11 20:03:15', '2015-04-11 14:33:15', '', 91, 'http://blog.thebookhub.in/91-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);
INSERT INTO `wp_posts` VALUES(105, 1, '2015-04-11 20:04:23', '2015-04-11 14:34:23', 'In the ‘Harry Potter’ series, how much do we actually focus on the one crucial character who had almost escaped having Harry’s fate just because he was born one day earlier than Harry? Who handled Snape’s wrath because if Lord Voldemort had gone for him, Lily would’ve survived? Who had his parents tortured to insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and the damage was so strong his mother didn’t recognize him and he lived in burning hell everyday knowing that he would never have the same connection with them that he had before? We may not accept it but living a life knowing your parents don’t know you is a fate worse than being dead. Sorry Harry but at least you know your parents would know you if they were alive. Neville Longbottom has our sympathy here *I don’t mean to be rude people* Let’s give it up to Neville’s true Gryffindor personality!\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville1.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville1-300x155.jpg" alt="hp-neville" width="300" height="155" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-92" /></a>\r\n\r\nNevilleLongbottom is that one important character who literally determines the whole course of series. He could’ve easily been ‘The Chosen One’, allowing Harry to be a normal wizard boy on ‘The Hogwarts Express’ without a scar, sitting with other kids, laughing without worries. But destiny had different plans for him. He did land up with scars, psychological ones, a little more painful than Harry’s. He has quite a lot of followers and fans in the fandom and who can blame him?\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/download.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/download.jpg" alt="download" width="194" height="260" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84" /></a>\r\n\r\nNot to forget his excruciatingly painful and good looks, he’s got the soul and qualities of a true Gryffindor – humility, nobility, kindness, loyalty, fierce supportiveness and bravery. Neville is a crystal clear reflection of the ‘real-life- Gryffindors, who have a potential to be true heroes under the most dangerous and life threatening situations, but not be a ‘Superman’ while sleeping and waking up. He clearly understands that being a person isn’t about being ‘the one’ who is always noticed no matter where they go and thrashing up villains at every freaking chance they get (No offence Harry, but Neville has his own points and you know it), it’s about deciding your battles and know what’s close enough to your heart and worth fighting for. \r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville3.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville3-300x168.jpg" alt="hp-neville3" width="300" height="168" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-85" /></a>\r\n\r\nNeville could’ve easily gotten Harry’s life by a span of one SINGLE DAY, has Voldemort seen him as a ‘real threat’ and let Harry live a little more normally.\r\nNow if we try to clearly dig into a little research, J K. Rowling has actually drawn Neville’s character from someone parallel in the previous generation: The Marauders. She did this with a lot of thinking, taking into account other characters. Neville is (please don’t kill ME) Peter Pettigrew. Okay! I’ll take the hurl of swear words till your actually understand why this was observed. He is the one who usually tags along with the trio but is looked down upon by everyone as he’s not remarkably talented or suave. He’s like the priest who knows every one of Harry’s most important secrets and could easily spill the beans. But then AGAIN! He’s a truly loyal Gryffindor! In addition, Professor McGonagall calls Peter Pettigrew ‘foolish boy’. Just like him Neville is another pureblood who has technically no respect from the notable wizarding families. Neville is the kid everyone picks on when Harry, Ron and Hermione aren’t around to defend him; gullible and the easy mark. He could’ve been Peter’s brand new analog in the story. \r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-peter.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-peter-300x164.jpg" alt="hp-peter" width="300" height="164" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-86" /></a>\r\n\r\nReason being – he can either ruin a dish or make it the epitome of perfection. He’s the game changer, tide turner and the shiny hinge. (whatever you want to call him) Apart from this, he’s in the same position as Wormtail, who made all the hard choices Wormtail didn’t. Of all the characters, Neville is the only one who goes the furthest to prove that an individual’s destiny is in his hands.  He of course, possesses other characteristics worth talking about, other than his own. What is important here is how his strengths fill in group dynamics needed by the Marauders. He’s wanted by the trio the same way Lily, James and the Order of Phoenix wanted Peter. Just that Neville is more than upto the task.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville2.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville2-300x161.jpg" alt="hp-neville2" width="300" height="161" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-87" /></a> \r\n\r\nNeville teaches us a lesson in self-worth and shows us that having a strong personality doesn''t always mean that  you''re meant to lead people and will only make the right decisions. Society at large only sees the leaders and their closest friends are dismissed at the first glance, pretty much like Neville was dismissed by his classmates in the first year. However, he doesn’t let his peers’ attitude affect him enough to give up. Instead, over the years. His self-depreciation turns into persistent desire to improve and increase his skill set on offering help irrespective of its need and he figures out how he can best come of use in a fight.\r\nHis very first act of heroism is seen in ‘Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone’ when he stands up to Harry, Ron and Hermione, becoming a victim to Hermione’s full ‘Body Bind’ curse which gives him enough points for Gryffindor to win the house Cup. He personally makes sure to announce Neville’s name at the last so as to make Neville proud of his bravery to stand up against his friends when he was right. (given that Dumbledore was actually scared that history would repeat itself and he was more than relieved that Neville chose a different road) Immediately after that incident, he avoids falling into Peter’s shoes by stepping away a little from the trio so that it showed people that his meekness isn’t a signal for people to mess around with him.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images-3.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images-3.jpg" alt="images (3)" width="276" height="183" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-94" /></a>\r\n\r\nHe’s the defender, the keeper of hope and a true friend. When Harry publicly claims to see Lord Voldemort in the fourth year, the world speculates and calls him a liar, making a mockery out of him. Neville however, sticks to his side and believes him, fighting with him unlike most who run away and pee in their pants when real danger comes. He keeps alive the ‘Dumbledore’s Army’ in Hogwarts despite Harry’s absence. He assumes the leader’s role, which was the hardest job anyone could do given Snape was the Headmaster during that time and builds a refuge in the ‘Room of Requirement’. Despite witnessing the murders, tortures and kidnappings of his closest friends, he stays hopeful in the castle, patiently waiting for Harry, Ron and Hermione to return. He’s the PRIME FACTOR for the ‘Battle of Hogwarts’ to take place. We can’t deny he was the spark that set the castle on fire. \r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville5.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hp-neville5-300x159.jpg" alt="hp-neville5" width="300" height="159" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-89" /></a>\r\n\r\nLeaving all this aside, Neville doesn’t fail his parents as the perfect son. Neville’s bravery, strength and love for his family keeps him fighting on for them even though they’re no longer there. He makes it his goal to be that ideal son though his parents would never know of his feats, deeds and mark in the wizarding world. \r\nIn the final hour, fate is about to make history repeat itself when he’s given the same cowardly choice of joining Voldemort and taking the easy way out. He changes the game at that very moment by drawing the sword of Gryffindor out of the burning Sorting Hat and slicing off Nagini’s head, ending Voldemort’s life. This moment proves that Harry needs Neville just the way he needs Ron and Hermione to end the war and put a cork in the bottle. It all comes down to Neville – the boy who demanded respect from his friends at the very start no matter how he felt and he chose to do what was right because it was the hardest thing to do.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/downloadii.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/downloadii.jpg" alt="downloadii" width="271" height="186" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-93" /></a>\r\n\r\nNow that we actually observe Neville under a whole new light, we discover that he’s indeed, the truest of Gryffindors and balances the entire HP narrative.

I am not certain if this piece achieves that goal, but the show literally changed my life and there seems to be no better means to celebrate that.\r\n\r\nThis American TV series was the brainchild of Marta Kauffman and David Crane who first developed the show under the working titles <em>Insomnia Café</em> and <em>Friends Like Us</em>. The plot is set in Manhattan, New York, and revolves around a closely knit group of six friends- Rachel Green, Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Joey Tribbiani, Chandler Bing and Ross Geller. Rachel and Monica were friends in high school and they began living together in Monica’s apartment when Rachel left her fiancé Barry at the altar. Ross, Monica’s elder brother was  best friends with Chandler since college. Joey was a struggling actor who shared an apartment with Chandler and Phoebe was a musician and masseuse by profession. Central Perk, the coffee house, was where their friendship grew over time. The show ran for ten straight years from September 22, 1994 to May 6, 2004.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Central-perk.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-107 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Central-perk-300x225.jpg" alt="Central-perk" width="382" height="286" /></a>\r\n\r\nIt has been over ten years since the finale episode aired on television and over twenty years since the magic began, but the show left behind a string attached. It has been my personal antidepressant ever since I watched it for the first time. Those six lives were weaved into a story that is a little like everyone’s own. Enveloped in humour, the storyline, the characters’ realities- all appear to be things we might have witnessed at some point in our lives- weight issues, unemployment, heartbreaks, failed marriages; or the dream jobs, the perfect soul mates, kids and of course, friends for life. The show offered so much that there was always a little something for everyone to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe success of any show primarily rides upon the writing and there is absolutely no doubt how well crafted FRIENDS was. However, in my opinion, it was the perfect ensemble cast that immortalised the show. Each actor gave more than a hundred percent to their job, adding personal touches to bring those characters to life. Their comic timing was impeccable and their real life friendships made the on-screen chemistry look remarkably organic. I had mentioned earlier that this show changed my life. That was because I began looking at things through the eyes of the characters, only to realise how much they were leaving behind for us to cherish retrospectively. (Yes! That is how obsessed I am with FRIENDS.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/monica.png"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-108 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/monica-300x181.png" alt="monica" width="300" height="181" /></a>Monica Geller, played by Courteney Cox, is perhaps the most relatable character on the show. Overcoming an obnoxious amount of weight, falling in love with a man who was as old as her father, chasing her life-long dream of becoming a chef, marrying her best friend and being a mother to twins- a trail of events that pushes one to be patient and to realise that letting things take their natural course is the best possible option because sooner or later, it will all begin to make sense. A hygiene freak, a fierce competitor and a meticulous organiser, Monica was, in ways more than one, the glue that held the group together. A sister, a wife, a mom, a chef and a friend- Monica Geller Bing.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/jennifer-aniston-then-and-now.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-109 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/jennifer-aniston-then-and-now-300x225.jpg" alt="jennifer-aniston-then-and-now" width="300" height="225" /></a>Rachel Green- the naive, scared, young woman who transformed herself into a confident professional- came across as any girl next door,  looking for a window of opportunity to do something worthwhile with her life. Her evolution into a somebody from a nobody gives us all the courage to never give up. Jennifer Aniston played this role to perfection. An independent woman, a single mother and the best roommate- Rachel “Gorgeous”  Green.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/friends06-sep221.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-119 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/friends06-sep221-300x200.jpg" alt="friends06-sep22" width="318" height="212" /></a>Someone who had an incredible zest for life and an indomitable spirit was Phoebe Buffay. In her unique, unpredictable ways, she teaches us to never back down and to never give up on one’s friends. Her eccentric songs added flavour to life. Lisa Kudrow eternalised Phoebe’s character. A musician, a dreamer, a matchmaker and a true friend- Phoebe “Smelly Cat” Buffay.\r\n<p style="text-align: left"><a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RoyReid.ca-Friends-13090602.png"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-111 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RoyReid.ca-Friends-13090602-300x228.png" alt="RoyReid.ca-Friends-13090602" width="300" height="228" /></a>You know how women are attracted to men with a good sense of humour, right? Chandler Bing was apparently aware of it too. Even so, he was stuck with Janice for a very long time. (Oh. My. God.) Could life <em>be</em> more cruel?! Played by Mathew Perry, Chandler was a guy’s guy and a man’s man. Overcoming one’s fears and mustering the courage to pursue something one truly loves, even at an uncertain age, is a good idea, is what he taught us. The best boyfriend, the best husband and the guy with the best one-liners on the show- Chandler Muriel Bing.</p>\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Matt-LeBlanc.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-112 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Matt-LeBlanc-300x200.jpg" alt="Matt-LeBlanc" width="300" height="200" /></a>Matt LeBlanc played the character of Joey Tribbiani- the charming lad who made being clueless so much fun. Picking up a fight with someone who made his friend cry, gobbling up the leftovers from the Thanksgiving dinner and being the ladies’ man, were all his departments. The huggable, adorable and magnetic young man looking for food? That is Joey “Hugsy” Tribbiani.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/david-schwimmer-friends.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-113 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/david-schwimmer-friends-300x281.jpg" alt="david schwimmer friends" width="300" height="281" /></a>Are you in high school and in love already? Do not tell the girl just yet. Wait till you complete your education. Get a PhD. Get married, and then get divorced. Have a child with your ex-wife. Then finally, tell your high school sweetheart that you like her. Date her for a couple of months. Break up with her. Get drunk with her and marry her. Get the marriage annulled. Have a kid with her. Encourage her to follow her dreams and move to a new country. Then go all the way to the airport the night that she is leaving and tell her you love her. Confused? That is Ross Geller for you. His tragedies aside, through Ross, one learns how rewarding it is to keep the needs of others before those of one''s own, to be kind and to be passionate about what one does. The dad, the older brother, the son, the ex-husband(three times over) and the best man- Dr. Ross “Dinosaur” Geller.\r\n\r\nFor a decade, these six friends gave all their loyal fans (over 50 million viewers who watched the finale episode, if you wish to know the exact numbers) a reason to believe in people and the bonds they forged with them over the years; and the power of these bonds to stand the test of time. They gave us hope for a better tomorrow; they taught us to hold on to our loved ones in the worst times and the best. Life is full of highs and lows and one can never really tell what turn it decides to take the next minute. This is what the journey of FRIENDS was about. It reached greater heights with every passing season and progressed from being a regular sitcom to a show that touched millions of lives and redefined the meaning of friendship. Ross and Rachel came a long way from falling in love with each other to having a baby together; Monica and Chandler set benchmarks for couples world over, Joey developed a dynamic personality from being a mere struggler to rising as a soap opera star and Phoebe, from being all over the place to finally finding her ground and settling down in life, showed us what growing up is all about.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/friends_3042394b.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-114 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/friends_3042394b-300x187.jpg" alt="BKB1TW Television Friends" width="400" height="249" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis popular TV series became one of the most loved shows ever not only because of its stellar performances, but also because of the many illustrious faces that adorned it. Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Charlie Sheen, Reese Witherspoon, Bruce Willis and Hugh Laurie, among many others, were part of this epic package. It is hard for me to believe that a set of six people completely unfamiliar with each other were able to strike the perfect chords from day one. Much went about in the lives of these real life stars that had its impact on the show. Courteney Cox married David Arquette, the director of the show, and had a daughter with him, named Coco. Interestingly, Courteney Cox made Jennifer Aniston Coco’s Godmother. Aniston married Brad Pitt in an extravagant ceremony during the course of the show. Lisa Kudrow was actually pregnant with her first child which is why the storyline was streamed to incorporate her pregnancy. Mathew Perry underwent rehabilitation while David Schwimmer ended up directing a few episodes of the show himself. Matt LeBlanc bagged a TV series titled <em>Joey</em> when FRIENDS ended. In all these years, their friendship has remained intact and they are often pictured together and are found guest starring on each other’s shows.\r\n\r\nAll this makes me wonder, how often does one come across a show telling us that it is okay to make mistakes, that people will come and go but the ones that are meant to be will stick around regardless of everything, that money and fancy jobs are relative things which wouldn’t even matter if one did not have the right people to celebrate their victories with, that choosing love over career is an incredibly brave thing to do and that overcoming inhibitions becomes much easier when one has their true friends by their side? Not very often, I believe.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, if you’re bombarded with memories from watching the show, consider yourself blessed, because you cried with the to-be Bings when Monica proposed to Chandler, because you did feel bad for Phoebe when she couldn’t mother her brother’s triplets, because you strangely agreed when Joey explained why it was all just a “moo point”, because you loved it when Joey and Chandler decided to pet the chick and the duck, because shopping in a sale with your girlfriends reminds you of the episode where Monica picks out her wedding dress, because you shed tears of joy when Rachel “got off the plane”, because you witnessed the myriad hues of life in 236 episodes. But if you have no thoughts flooding your minds and you have not understood the references made, you have my sympathies, for you did miss out on a slice of life itself.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TheLastOneBow.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-115 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TheLastOneBow-300x195.jpg" alt="TheLastOneBow" width="382" height="248" /></a>\r\n<p style="text-align: center">To the six friends who changed my life.</p>', 'The Six F.R.I.E.N.D.S Who Changed My Life', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-six-f-r-i-e-n-d-s-who-changed-my-life', '', '', '2015-04-15 19:51:34', '2015-04-15 14:21:34', '', 0, 'http://blog.thebookhub.in/?p=106', 0, 'post', '', 15);

The plot is set in Manhattan, New York, and revolves around a closely knit group of six friends- Rachel Green, Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Joey Tribbiani, Chandler Bing and Ross Geller. Rachel and Monica were friends in high school and they began living together in Monica’s apartment when Rachel left her fiancé Barry at the altar. Ross, Monica’s elder brother was  best friends with Chandler since college. Joey was a struggling actor who shared an apartment with Chandler and Phoebe was a musician and masseuse by profession. Central Perk, the coffee house, was where their friendship grew over time. The show ran for ten straight years from September 22, 1994 to May 6, 2004.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Central-perk.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-107 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Central-perk-300x225.jpg" alt="Central-perk" width="382" height="286" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt has been over ten years since the finale episode aired on television and over twenty years since the magic began, but the show left behind a string attached. It has been my personal antidepressant ever since I watched it for the first time. Those six lives were weaved into a story that is a little like everyone’s own. Enveloped in humour, the storyline, the characters’ realities- all appear to be things we might have witnessed at some point in our lives- weight issues, unemployment, heartbreaks, failed marriages; or the dream jobs, the perfect soul mates, kids and of course, friends for life. The show offered so much that there was always a little something for everyone to enjoy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe success of any show primarily rides upon the writing and there is absolutely no doubt how well crafted FRIENDS was. However, in my opinion, it was the perfect ensemble cast that immortalised the show. Each actor gave more than a hundred percent to their job, adding personal touches to bring those characters to life. Their comic timings were impeccable and their real life friendships made the on-screen chemistry look remarkably organic. I had mentioned earlier that this show changed my life. That was because I began looking at things through the eyes of the characters, only to realise how much they were leaving behind for us to cherish retrospectively. (Yes!

Overcoming an obnoxious amount of weight, falling in love with a man who was as old as her father, chasing her life-long dream of becoming a chef, marrying her best friend and being a mother to twins- a trail of events that pushes one to be patient and to realise that letting things take their natural course is the best possible option because sooner or later, it will all begin to make sense. A hygiene freak, a fierce competitor and a meticulous organiser, Monica was, in ways more than one, the glue that held the group together.

Do not tell the girl just yet. Wait till you complete your education. Get a PhD. Get married, and then get divorced. Have a child with your ex-wife. Then finally, tell your high school sweetheart that you like her. Date her for a couple of months. Break up with her. Get drunk with her and marry her. Get the marriage annulled. Have a kid with her. Encourage her to follow her dreams and move to a new country. Then go all the way to the airport the night that she is leaving and tell her you love her. Confused? That is Ross Geller for you. His tragedies aside, through Ross, one learns how rewarding it is to keep the needs of others before those of one''s own, to be kind and to be passionate about what one does. The dad, the older brother, the son, the ex-husband(three times over) and the best man- Dr. Ross “Dinosaur” Geller.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor a decade, these six friends gave all their loyal fans (over 50 million viewers who watched the finale episode, if you wish to know the exact numbers) a reason to believe in people and the bonds they forged with them over the years; and the power of these bonds to stand the test of time. They gave us hope for a better tomorrow; they taught us to hold on to our loved ones in the worst times and the best. Life is full of highs and lows and one can never really tell what turn it decides to take the next minute. This is what the journey of FRIENDS was about. It reached greater heights with every passing season and progressed from being a regular sitcom to a show that touched millions of lives and redefined the meaning of friendship. Ross and Rachel came a long way from falling in love with each other to having a baby together; Monica and Chandler set benchmarks for couples world over, Joey developed a dynamic personality from being a mere struggler to rising as a soap opera star and Phoebe, from being all over the place to finally finding her ground and settling down in life, showed us what growing up is all about.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/friends_3042394b.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-114 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/friends_3042394b-300x187.jpg" alt="BKB1TW Television Friends" width="400" height="249" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis popular TV series became one of the most loved shows ever not only because of its stellar performances, but also because of the many illustrious faces that adorned it. Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Charlie Sheen, Reese Witherspoon, Bruce Willis and Hugh Laurie, among many others, were part of this epic package. It is hard for me to believe that a set of six people completely unfamiliar with each other were able to strike the perfect chords from day one. Much went about in the lives of these real life stars that had its impact on the show. Courteney Cox married David Arquette, the director of the show, and had a daughter with him, named Coco. Interestingly, Courteney Cox made Jennifer Aniston Coco’s Godmother. Aniston married Brad Pitt in an extravagant ceremony during the course of the show. Lisa Kudrow was actually pregnant with her first child which is why the storyline was streamed to incorporate her pregnancy. Mathew Perry underwent rehabilitation while David Schwimmer ended up directing a few episodes of the show himself. Matt LeBlanc bagged a TV series titled <em>Joey</em> when FRIENDS ended. In all these years, their friendship has remained intact and they are often pictured together and are found guest starring on each other’s shows.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAll this makes me wonder, how often does one come across a show telling us that it is okay to make mistakes, that people will come and go but the ones that are meant to be will stick around regardless of everything, that money and fancy jobs are relative things which wouldn’t even matter if one did not have the right people to celebrate their victories with, that choosing love over career is an incredibly brave thing to do and that overcoming inhibitions becomes much easier when one has their true friends by their side? Not very often, I believe.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAt this moment, if you’re bombarded with memories from watching the show, consider yourself blessed, because you cried with the to-be Bings when Monica proposed to Chandler, because you did feel bad for Phoebe when she couldn’t mother her brother’s triplets, because you strangely agreed when Joey explained why it was all just a “moo point”, because you loved it when Joey and Chandler decided to pet the chick and the duck, because shopping in a sale with your girlfriends reminds you of the episode where Monica picks out her wedding dress, because you shed tears of joy when Rachel “got off the plane”, because you witnessed the myriad hues of life in 236 episodes. But if you have no thoughts flooding your minds and you have not understood the references made, you have my sympathies, for you did miss out on a slice of life itself.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TheLastOneBow.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-115 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TheLastOneBow-300x195.jpg" alt="TheLastOneBow" width="382" height="248" /></a>\r\n<p style="text-align: center">To the six friends who changed my life.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center"></p>', 'The Six F.R.I.E.N.D.S Who Changed My Life', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '106-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-04-15 17:59:28', '2015-04-15 12:29:28', '', 106, 'http://blog.thebookhub.in/106-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

The plot is set in Manhattan, New York, and revolves around a closely knit group of six friends- Rachel Green, Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Joey Tribbiani, Chandler Bing and Ross Geller. Rachel and Monica were friends in high school and they began living together in Monica’s apartment when Rachel left her fiancé Barry at the altar. Ross, Monica’s elder brother was  best friends with Chandler since college. Joey was a struggling actor who shared an apartment with Chandler and Phoebe was a musician and masseuse by profession.

Enveloped in humour, the storyline, the characters’ realities- all appear to be things we might have witnessed at some point in our lives- weight issues, unemployment, heartbreaks, failed marriages; or the dream jobs, the perfect soul mates, kids and of course, friends for life. The show offered so much that there was always a little something for everyone to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe success of any show primarily rides upon the writing and there is absolutely no doubt how well crafted FRIENDS was. However, in my opinion, it was the perfect ensemble cast that immortalised the show. Each actor gave more than a hundred percent to their job, adding personal touches to bring those characters to life. Their comic timings were impeccable and their real life friendships made the on-screen chemistry look remarkably organic. I had mentioned earlier that this show changed my life.

Overcoming an obnoxious amount of weight, falling in love with a man who was as old as her father, chasing her life-long dream of becoming a chef, marrying her best friend and being a mother to twins- a trail of events that pushes one to be patient and to realise that letting things take their natural course is the best possible option because sooner or later, it will all begin to make sense. A hygiene freak, a fierce competitor and a meticulous organiser, Monica was, in ways more than one, the glue that held the group together.

They gave us hope for a better tomorrow; they taught us to hold on to our loved ones in the worst times and the best. Life is full of highs and lows and one can never really tell what turn it decides to take the next minute. This is what the journey of FRIENDS was about.

I am not certain if this piece achieves that goal, but the show literally changed my life and there seems to be no better means to celebrate that.\r\n\r\nThis American TV series was the brainchild of Marta Kauffman and David Crane who first developed the show under the working titles <em>Insomnia Café</em> and <em>Friends Like Us</em>. The plot is set in Manhattan, New York, and revolves around a closely knit group of six friends- Rachel Green, Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Joey Tribbiani, Chandler Bing and Ross Geller. Rachel and Monica were friends in high school and they began living together in Monica’s apartment when Rachel left her fiancé Barry at the altar. Ross, Monica’s elder brother was  best friends with Chandler since college. Joey was a struggling actor who shared an apartment with Chandler and Phoebe was a musician and masseuse by profession. Central Perk, the coffee house, was where their friendship grew over time. The show ran for ten straight years from September 22, 1994 to May 6, 2004.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Central-perk.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-107 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Central-perk-300x225.jpg" alt="Central-perk" width="382" height="286" /></a>\r\n\r\nIt has been over ten years since the finale episode aired on television and over twenty years since the magic began, but the show left behind a string attached. It has been my personal antidepressant ever since I watched it for the first time. Those six lives were weaved into a story that is a little like everyone’s own. Enveloped in humour, the storyline, the characters’ realities- all appear to be things we might have witnessed at some point in our lives- weight issues, unemployment, heartbreaks, failed marriages; or the dream jobs, the perfect soul mates, kids and of course, friends for life. The show offered so much that there was always a little something for everyone to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe success of any show primarily rides upon the writing and there is absolutely no doubt how well crafted FRIENDS was. However, in my opinion, it was the perfect ensemble cast that immortalised the show. Each actor gave more than a hundred percent to their job, adding personal touches to bring those characters to life. Their comic timing was impeccable and their real life friendships made the on-screen chemistry look remarkably organic. I had mentioned earlier that this show changed my life. That was because I began looking at things through the eyes of the characters, only to realise how much they were leaving behind for us to cherish retrospectively. (Yes! That is how obsessed I am with FRIENDS.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/monica.png"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-108 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/monica-300x181.png" alt="monica" width="300" height="181" /></a>Monica Geller, played by Courteney Cox, is perhaps the most relatable character on the show. Overcoming an obnoxious amount of weight, falling in love with a man who was as old as her father, chasing her life-long dream of becoming a chef, marrying her best friend and being a mother to twins- a trail of events that pushes one to be patient and to realise that letting things take their natural course is the best possible option because sooner or later, it will all begin to make sense. A hygiene freak, a fierce competitor and a meticulous organiser, Monica was, in ways more than one, the glue that held the group together. A sister, a wife, a mom, a chef and a friend- Monica Geller Bing.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/jennifer-aniston-then-and-now.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-109 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/jennifer-aniston-then-and-now-300x225.jpg" alt="jennifer-aniston-then-and-now" width="300" height="225" /></a>Rachel Green- the naive, scared, young woman who transformed herself into a confident professional- came across as any girl next door,  looking for a window of opportunity to do something worthwhile with her life. Her evolution into a somebody from a nobody gives us all the courage to never give up. Jennifer Aniston played this role to perfection. An independent woman, a single mother and the best roommate- Rachel “Gorgeous”  Green.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/friends06-sep221.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-119 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/friends06-sep221-300x200.jpg" alt="friends06-sep22" width="318" height="212" /></a>Someone who had an incredible zest for life and an indomitable spirit was Phoebe Buffay. In her unique, unpredictable ways, she teaches us to never back down and to never give up on one’s friends. Her eccentric songs added flavour to life. Lisa Kudrow eternalised Phoebe’s character. A musician, a dreamer, a matchmaker and a true friend- Phoebe “Smelly Cat” Buffay.\r\n<p style="text-align: left"><a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RoyReid.ca-Friends-13090602.png"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-111 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RoyReid.ca-Friends-13090602-300x228.png" alt="RoyReid.ca-Friends-13090602" width="300" height="228" /></a>You know how women are attracted to men with a good sense of humour, right? Chandler Bing was apparently aware of it too. Even so, he was stuck with Janice for a very long time. (Oh. My. God.) Could life <em>be</em> more cruel?! Played by Mathew Perry, Chandler was a guy’s guy and a man’s man. Overcoming one’s fears and mustering the courage to pursue something one truly loves, even at an uncertain age, is a good idea, is what he taught us. The best boyfriend, the best husband and the guy with the best one-liners on the show- Chandler Muriel Bing.</p>\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Matt-LeBlanc.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-112 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Matt-LeBlanc-300x200.jpg" alt="Matt-LeBlanc" width="300" height="200" /></a>Matt LeBlanc played the character of Joey Tribbiani- the charming lad who made being clueless so much fun. Picking up a fight with someone who made his friend cry, gobbling up the leftovers from the Thanksgiving dinner and being the ladies’ man, were all his departments. The huggable, adorable and magnetic young man looking for food? That is Joey “Hugsy” Tribbiani.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/david-schwimmer-friends.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-113 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/david-schwimmer-friends-300x281.jpg" alt="david schwimmer friends" width="300" height="281" /></a>Are you in high school and in love already? Do not tell the girl just yet. Wait till you complete your education. Get a PhD. Get married, and then get divorced. Have a child with your ex-wife. Then finally, tell your high school sweetheart that you like her. Date her for a couple of months. Break up with her. Get drunk with her and marry her. Get the marriage annulled. Have a kid with her. Encourage her to follow her dreams and move to a new country. Then go all the way to the airport the night that she is leaving and tell her you love her. Confused? That is Ross Geller for you. His tragedies aside, through Ross, one learns how rewarding it is to keep the needs of others before those of one''s own, to be kind and to be passionate about what one does. The dad, the older brother, the son, the ex-husband(three times over) and the best man- Dr. Ross “Dinosaur” Geller.\r\n\r\nFor a decade, these six friends gave all their loyal fans (over 50 million viewers who watched the finale episode, if you wish to know the exact numbers) a reason to believe in people and the bonds they forged with them over the years; and the power of these bonds to stand the test of time. They gave us hope for a better tomorrow; they taught us to hold on to our loved ones in the worst times and the best. Life is full of highs and lows and one can never really tell what turn it decides to take the next minute. This is what the journey of FRIENDS was about. It reached greater heights with every passing season and progressed from being a regular sitcom to a show that touched millions of lives and redefined the meaning of friendship. Ross and Rachel came a long way from falling in love with each other to having a baby together; Monica and Chandler set benchmarks for couples world over, Joey developed a dynamic personality from being a mere struggler to rising as a soap opera star and Phoebe, from being all over the place to finally finding her ground and settling down in life, showed us what growing up is all about.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/friends_3042394b.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-114 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/friends_3042394b-300x187.jpg" alt="BKB1TW Television Friends" width="400" height="249" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis popular TV series became one of the most loved shows ever not only because of its stellar performances, but also because of the many illustrious faces that adorned it. Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Charlie Sheen, Reese Witherspoon, Bruce Willis and Hugh Laurie, among many others, were part of this epic package. It is hard for me to believe that a set of six people completely unfamiliar with each other were able to strike the perfect chords from day one. Much went about in the lives of these real life stars that had its impact on the show. Courteney Cox married David Arquette, the director of the show, and had a daughter with him, named Coco. Interestingly, Courteney Cox made Jennifer Aniston Coco’s Godmother. Aniston married Brad Pitt in an extravagant ceremony during the course of the show. Lisa Kudrow was actually pregnant with her first child which is why the storyline was streamed to incorporate her pregnancy. Mathew Perry underwent rehabilitation while David Schwimmer ended up directing a few episodes of the show himself. Matt LeBlanc bagged a TV series titled <em>Joey</em> when FRIENDS ended. In all these years, their friendship has remained intact and they are often pictured together and are found guest starring on each other’s shows.\r\n\r\nAll this makes me wonder, how often does one come across a show telling us that it is okay to make mistakes, that people will come and go but the ones that are meant to be will stick around regardless of everything, that money and fancy jobs are relative things which wouldn’t even matter if one did not have the right people to celebrate their victories with, that choosing love over career is an incredibly brave thing to do and that overcoming inhibitions becomes much easier when one has their true friends by their side? Not very often, I believe.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, if you’re bombarded with memories from watching the show, consider yourself blessed, because you cried with the to-be Bings when Monica proposed to Chandler, because you did feel bad for Phoebe when she couldn’t mother her brother’s triplets, because you strangely agreed when Joey explained why it was all just a “moo point”, because you loved it when Joey and Chandler decided to pet the chick and the duck, because shopping in a sale with your girlfriends reminds you of the episode where Monica picks out her wedding dress, because you shed tears of joy when Rachel “got off the plane”, because you witnessed the myriad hues of life in 236 episodes. But if you have no thoughts flooding your minds and you have not understood the references made, you have my sympathies, for you did miss out on a slice of life itself.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TheLastOneBow.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-115 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TheLastOneBow-300x195.jpg" alt="TheLastOneBow" width="382" height="248" /></a>\r\n<p style="text-align: center">To the six friends who changed my life.</p>', 'The Six F.R.I.E.N.D.S Who Changed My Life', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '106-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-04-15 19:51:34', '2015-04-15 14:21:34', '', 106, 'http://blog.thebookhub.in/106-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

There’s something for everything. Technology may be a boon to mankind and you could say it’s a blessing for those who don’t like carrying books around in their bags and take the care of maintaining them, but then every coin has a flip side: the screen of ‘Kindle’ could crack for all you know, one click of a button and you could just lose your opportunity of reading. You could drop them and damage them. E-books stored on laptops and computers; they have a chance of getting lost with the hard-drive crash or any technological glitch for that matter. Handling them with care is another clause that comes with technological products. Not to forget the strain on your eyes when you keep staring at a screen for hours while reading and then comes along another problem – ‘Kindle’ runs on battery that can expire or run out of charge or even get damaged. Without the battery, ‘Kindle’ is basically a box with books that can’t be accessed. Books, you can carry them anywhere, anytime in any condition; no worries of the ‘Kindle’ not being able to withstand extreme temperatures. Books, you fix them up with tape, put some classic binding and glue them up; all at a reasonable cost. No need to go to a technician and spend a thousand bucks and wait for days to just read a few books!!  I mean c’mon! Paper is so much better than pixels!\r\n1.	True ownership of a book:\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images.jpg"><img src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/images-300x168.jpg" alt="images" width="300" height="168" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-126" /></a>\r\n\r\nIt’s true that you can own a book and an ‘e-book’. But even the ownership is different in nature. Book makes you have a feel of the ‘physical ownership’, in hard-copy. It becomes a part of yourself. You can hug it and go to sleep. Sit peacefully on a beach, reading a book, with the waves kissing your body and receding, no worries of dropping your book in the water and losing it because the water seeped into the hardware and destroyed it. It’s your constant companion. Scribble notes and ideas, literally and symbolically mark your territory over it. The highlights and markings are one aspect. Then comes the interaction and engaging process with the book.\r\n The plus point – there are visible marks that you’ve bonded with your book. Only if you have a proper book, will people ever know you’ve read it; or anyone else for that matter. You see bent and ‘dog-eared’ pages, a shaking and loose book spine, signs of age and use. People will come to know that the reader has been impacted by the book, the story has had an effect on their lives. On the other hand, send an e-book to someone else; if you get it back, you’ll see the highlights and notes gone, because that’s just how technology is. The ownership belongs to you or your device, not to the book. Last but not the least, when you often to go to a library and see an old book, flip through its pages. See the notes and ideas written over the pages. You’ll get an idea of what kind of experiences different people had with the book and how it has made a mark on those lives. This can never be reproduced in an e-book format.\r\n\r\n2.	Loan  a Book:\r\nYou ask me why I hate e-books; they CAN’T be loaned! They have some kind of digital rights management involved which bonds a book to a particular owner. On buying a Kindle book, you could have a copy of it on your device but then again! There comes the system of linking the devices with various accounts. It’s all painful technological processes everywhere just to give yourself the pleasure of reading a great story. In case of books, you can loan one or two or any number. That’s the best – anywhere, any way, any time how much ever. In case of Kindle, you have to loan your entire reading device; basically, either you loan everything or nothing at all. Then again, even if an e-book doesn’t have any digital management rights, loaning it is very different from actual loaning. It’s actually ‘duplicating’ a book. When you loan someone a book, they actually witness your experience with it. There’s a level of trust, intimacy and shared experience in loaning books which can’t be found in electronic books.\r\n\r\n3.	A single tasking device. \r\nA book is inherently opposed to multi-tasking. Not more than one or two tasks can be performed while reading it. This indirectly implies that a reader can devote nearly 90% of his attention to the story that he/she is reading. No distraction, no problem.  This allows the reader to have the best possible reading experience and actually enjoy it. E-books on the other hand, are technological devices crafted in such a way that multi-tasking is made possible. Stored in I-Pads or anything else for that matter, e-books contain hyper-links and built-in dictionary and many other applications somehow related to reading which drive the reader away from the wholesome reading experience. They buzz, beep and disengage the reader in many ways.\r\n\r\n4.	One can buy a used book.\r\nWalk down a street and see if you can see even a single e-book store as compared to outlets selling used books. E-books can never be USED, let’s face it. They stay cold, unblemished and untouched but only duplicated for years to come. Their prices never change, they can never be dug out of boxes like long lost treasure and never suddenly turn up like unexpected old gifts from us to us. They can never be loaned or resold. They stay fresh, unused and forever sustained. There are NO  rare first editions or special editions. A used book will be a vestige of the past but irreplaceable and vintage.\r\n\r\nBecause books are the BEST inventions till date!\r\n', 'Why books will always be magical', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '123-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-04-18 20:29:48', '2015-04-18 14:59:48', '', 123, 'http://blog.thebookhub.in/123-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

There’s a level of trust, intimacy and shared experience in loaning books which can’t be found in electronic books.\r\n\r\n3.	A single tasking device. \r\nA book is inherently opposed to multi-tasking. Not more than one or two tasks can be performed while reading it. This indirectly implies that a reader can devote nearly 90% of his attention to the story that he/she is reading. No distraction, no problem.  This allows the reader to have the best possible reading experience and actually enjoy it. E-books on the other hand, are technological devices crafted in such a way that multi-tasking is made possible. Stored in I-Pads or anything else for that matter, e-books contain hyper-links and built-in dictionary and many other applications somehow related to reading which drive the reader away from the wholesome reading experience. They buzz, beep and disengage the reader in many ways.\r\n\r\n4.	One can buy a used book.\r\nWalk down a street and see if you can see even a single e-book store as compared to outlets selling used books. E-books can never be USED, let’s face it. They stay cold, unblemished and untouched but only duplicated for years to come. Their prices never change, they can never be dug out of boxes like long lost treasure and never suddenly turn up like unexpected old gifts from us to us. They can never be loaned or resold. They stay fresh, unused and forever sustained. There are NO  rare first editions or special editions. A used book will be a vestige of the past but irreplaceable and vintage.\r\n\r\nBecause books are the BEST inventions till date!\r\n', 'Why books will always be magical', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '123-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-04-18 23:44:40', '2015-04-18 18:14:40', '', 123, 'http://blog.thebookhub.in/123-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

The moment I  penned the last word of my story, I felt satisfied knowing that I had done justice to the characters of my story. It was a beautiful feeling. But then, my heart broke knowing that I had to bid goodbye to them.Though it wasn''t really a goodbye.''</em>\r\n\r\nHonestly, I wasn''t intending on writing what I''m going to write at this moment. My first thought was, ''I had an exhilarating experience. I can''t make a draft of it and then write it out. It''ll be better if I''m spontaneous.''\r\n\r\nHere I am.\r\n\r\nI looked at myself in the mirror. My eyes resembled those of Lord Voldemort - scarlet red. Yes, they were tired and looked bloodshot after the period of time I spent trying to figure out the character and personality of my story''s protagonist. It had been a good number of two hours and till now I just knew that my protagonist was a 15 year old girl who had cancer and then my thoughts trailed off into a fading train of words as my eyes flitted to the half written page.\r\n\r\n<img src="https://dkzstslcvgwbc.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/resize/inline_image/images12_0-367x275.jpg" alt="" />\r\n\r\nMy inspiration looked as bleak as a candle flame that was dying out. I had tobring it back before it went extinct. With full determination, I picked up my pen, refraining myself from looking at the time, for time meant nothing for me right now. I had a story to write.\r\n\r\nI happily toiled away and burnt the midnight oil. Occasionally, there was a violent outbreak in my mind when a chunk of ideas used to aggressively knock on the doors of my brain, trying to get in. With great difficulty, I turned a deaf ear to them, for I knew that ''too many cooks spoil a good broth.'' The most painful and crucial part was the game changer, the twist in the story. It''s never easy to decide how you want your story to go about, specially when you''re not sure of what''s going to happen next and also when you don''t know what kind of literature people like reading. There are so many different tastes and preferences but just one story.\r\n\r\n''Pen down the first scenario that comes to the mind'' - that was the easiest strategy I planned to adopt. I am no pro at writing but only an emerging writer. I had to give this piece a lovely form with the simplest ideas. I had to give my characters the closure they needed. My characters were like my children, my own family and I couldn''t abandon them on some random page of a diary!\r\n\r\n<img src="https://dkzstslcvgwbc.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/resize/inline_image/family_1-347x257.jpg" alt="" />\r\n\r\nIn sometime I realized my growing attachment to my newly found family that I had discovered in the hidden corners of my own mind. I found myself laughing, crying and rejoicing with them; protecting them from every destructive and masochistic thought that came to my mind. They were a part of me and hurting them would be like hurting myself.\r\n\r\nI was halfway through my story by then and I felt that this was one hell of a journey I had while writing one. Like a trip to a world from where I didn''t want to come back. I was free; to feel, do and say whatever I wanted to. It was beautiful and liberating with the right people. My creations were no less than people.\r\n\r\nHowever, this did include a big deal of mental dilemma, literary complications and ups and downs. Writing something is not a piece of cake, I assure you. You have to pick the right words. You can''t write something and turn it into something else. You have to know what you want and how you intend to go about it. You can''t lose track and then come back to write any nonsense just to make it a part of the work. It should make some sense.\r\n\r\n<img src="https://dkzstslcvgwbc.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/resize/inline_image/hotguy-443x295.jpg" alt="" />\r\n\r\nWell, enough said, I snapped back to reality as I realized that the story was now nearing the climax. That''s what broke my heart. This had to end anyway. Sooner or later. They were going away from me. Yet another family was going to be preserved in the pages of my diary. Another lesson and wonderful experience with memories to cherish. Like a part of myself had latched onto those people I talked to but never seen. The pain ripped me apart. Into a million pieces.\r\n\r\nMaybe what Stephen King said was right after all.\r\n\r\n"JK Rowling created seven <em>Horcruxes</em>. She put a part of her soul in every book and now her books will live forever"\r\n\r\nI guess I did the same. But it was painful enough with just one story.\r\n\r\nThe essence of a story is different when it''s complete. It''s captivating. I could go on reading mine for hours and hours but not get bored. To make myself believe that the pain would subside and lie to my heart that it wasn''t over.\r\n\r\nA completed story is a wonder to behold.\r\n\r\n<strong>A beautiful heartbreak.</strong>', 'The beautiful heartbreak', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '229-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-06-10 20:21:39', '2015-06-10 14:51:39', '', 229, 'http://blog.thebookhub.in/229-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

INSERT INTO `wp_posts` VALUES(177, 2, '2015-05-13 14:26:21', '2015-05-13 08:56:21', 'Being a small town girl never deterred me from thinking big. I would always picture myself wearing crisp, ironed formal clothes, meeting with a host of people from all over the world and travelling round the globe. I have had the ‘I-want-to-be-the-President-of-India’ phase or the ‘my-life-is-going-to-be-a-long-fancy-holiday’ phase. People would tell me how unrealistic a kid I could sometimes be. But I would pay no heed to them. Basically, Bollywood had ruined me forever!\r\n\r\nI am certain that most of those who are reading this must, at some point or the other, have had similar dreams. Vague, impractical, distorted images of our future selves, fashioned from the cameras of impassioned daydreaming. Bursting our bubble, however, reality did to our larger-than-life ideas what a flame does to a moth. At every step, the impediments grew mightier.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/download.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-166 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/download.jpg" alt="download" width="456" height="303" /></a>\r\nMoving to a metropolitan city turns one’s life around. Meeting new people, engaging oneself in dialogue and discussions, looking after oneself because no one else will- opens our eyes to the real world, marking a departure from our utopian wonderlands. A world where no matter how good one might think they are, they will always find an equal, if not better, match. A place where one realises that they will soon be expected to shoulder serious responsibilities, to get one’s life together and to prove one’s mettle while they are at it. A place where a line of distinction is drawn between being well-trained and being well educated; where one finally comes to realise that test scores are really just numbers, that often prove to be an insufficient and unjust parameter to judge a person’s true calibre. All this, if one does not lose their sanity amidst the bright lights and deafening noise, of course.\r\n\r\nThe flip side has a different story to tell. For someone who has led a simplistic lifestyle, the fast-paced atmosphere of an urban setting can be scary to cope up with. For them, the competition is too fierce, the pressure too high, the voices too loud, the choices too extreme, the expectations too burdensome and life too twisted. They often lose themselves in the search of things that are far beyond their reach.\r\n\r\nHaving lived in a metropolitan for about two years, makes me wonder, like anyone else, as to where my life is headed. While big cities offer varied opportunities, they also baffle young minds. A hundred different people narrating a hundred different versions of a strange tale-what to do and what not to do. Enveloped in such surroundings, it can be difficult to hold on to one’s ground. But amidst all this, there is an invisible force drawing us back to the city. The city which teaches one that none will ever know them the way they know themselves, and that they may never know someone else too well either; the city that encourages one to embrace challenges and take risks; that which pushes one to stand right back up after every fall; that which reminds one how people come and go but the only thing they can constantly hold onto is, the self- mind and soul intact; that which trains one to believe, and to never underestimate the wonders of honest hard work.

He cofounded Apple in his Parent’s garage with Steve Wozniak, was ousted a decade later and then returned, twelve years later to rescue Apple Inc. from the brink of bankruptcy and in 2011, helped Apple become the world’s most valuable company.

A product was insanely great or a piece of crap, a dish served to him was the best thing ever or downright inedible. And similarly, the highs of his life were unimaginable but the lows were rock bottom and terrifying. But there was only one singularity to his life, he loved what he did. And in his commencement address at Stanford in 2005, that was what he asked of the graduating students, to keep looking for what they love, to not settle for anything less.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n“The only way to do great work is to love what you do. Keep looking, Don’t Settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on, So keep looking until you find it, Don’t settle.”\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/alg-steve-jobs-stanford-jpg.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-192" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/alg-steve-jobs-stanford-jpg-300x200.jpg" alt="alg-steve-jobs-stanford-jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>\r\n\r\nHe was a perfection Nazi, one obsessed with perfecting each bit of the each work he ever did. During the development of almost every product he ever created, Jobs hit the pause button and went back to the drawing board because he felt it wasn’t perfect.  His perfectionism extended even to parts unseen. As a young boy, he had helped his father build a fence around their backyard, and he was told they had to use as much care on the back of the fence as on the front. “Nobody will ever know,” Steve said. His father replied “But you will know.”\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipadiphoneipod.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-193" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipadiphoneipod-300x250.jpg" alt="ipadiphoneipod" width="300" height="250" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHe took his father’s lessons to heart and today, as a person who read a 560 page biography of him, there are many lessons I’ve learnt.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe book by Walter Isaacson is only a vast collection of anecdotes, incidents and happenings that shaped his life but for me, it is a Bible, having an answer to each question of mine.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/FB_IMG_1430991572257.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-189" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/FB_IMG_1430991572257-300x294.jpg" alt="FB_IMG_1430991572257" width="300" height="294" /></a>\r\n\r\nI believe that every great act in Human History can trace its roots back to the right person picking up the right book.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI know that I’ve picked up the right book, I just need to become the right person', 'A Tale of Processors and Poetry', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '187-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-05-23 17:04:42', '2015-05-23 11:34:42', '', 187, 'http://blog.thebookhub.in/187-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

A simple way of letting someone know that one is outside their room and wants to get in. Easy, right? Then why do we forget (or choose to ignore) to put ourselves into the habit of doing so? Similarly, why do we not cover our mouths and noses while we cough and sneeze? Why do some of us start fidgeting with our noses in the middle of nowhere, with utter disregard for people around, who are forced to be a witness to that unpleasant sight? Gross, you say? YES!

As long as it is not in the house, the problem is not ours, isn’t it? She could have thrown it right behind the building on a pile of trash that just magically started existing- because we never went out to throw anything there, did we? And while it sits there, why not throw our garbage in too? What big a difference could it possibly make?

Why does the tag “reserved for women passengers” become so important then? Why do we then let our manners and etiquette go for a toss?\r\n\r\nHow difficult can it be to turn around and apologise for stepping on to someone’s shoe? How troublesome can it be to thank the driver who got you home safely, or the lift-man or the grocery vendor for their respective services? How much can one’s ego be hurt by letting a woman or a child ahead while entering a room?

While for many years, I blindly believed this statement, recently I decided to do a background check at the legitimacy of this statement. Although initially everything seemed well in place, I slowly started stumbling upon factual errors and wrong information being sold to the public. Taking for granted that a majority of the readers will not know much about the backgrounds of the works, Dan Brown added mysterious societies and strange rituals which appealed to the audience, even more so because the audience mostly if not wholly believed that the these societies and rituals existed. I however felt a little cheated for being made to believe something that is not true and hence I would like to bring out a few factual errors in what is considered Dan Brown’s best work, The Da Vinci Code.\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong><em>The Priory of Sion:</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nAccording to the book, the Priory of Sion is an ancient organization connected to Goddess worship. Dan Brown writes that the organization was founded in 1099 and it was named after the Biblical Mount Zion. The truth is however very different. The Priory of Sion was actually founded in1956 by Pierre Plantard, Andre Bonhomme and others and was named after a mountain in France.\r\n<ol start="2">\r\n	<li><strong><em>Opus Dei</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThe book claims that the Opus Dei is a monastic order which is the Pope’s ‘personal prelature’. Silas the murderer is said to be an Opus Dei monk who uses a cilice to flagellate himself and receives very deep wounds. Factually Opus Dei has no monks and Dan Brown greatly exaggerates the effects of voluntary mortification of flesh as the kind of wounds described in the book cannot be caused from a normal cilice.\r\n<ol start="3">\r\n	<li><strong><em>The Rosslyn Chapel</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThe Chapel is a major feature in the last part of the novel, though many incorrect assertions were made about the structure. The book states that the Chapel was built by the Knights Templar, and contains a six-pointed Star of David worn into the stone floor although such star has never been seen in the floor. Also the chapel was founded by William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness of the Scoto-Norman Sinclair family and not by the Knights Templar\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR6KbQasx634TE8fmh9Y0XugyTcl0LNAVPcupet5a7eq9-8aM0U" alt="" width="259" height="194" /></p>\r\n\r\n<ol start="4">\r\n	<li><strong><em>The Vatican</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nIn the story, the Vatican is said to be the center of power in the early Catholic Church. It is said that that there is a reference to the Vatican in the Gnostic Writings of the 4<sup>th</sup> century. However it was not until the 15<sup>th</sup> century that there was anything like official power in the vicinity of the Vatican Hill in Rome. In the 4<sup>th</sup> century all that existed of the Vatican was a little more than a church and cemetery by the side of the road. Also the book claims that St. Peter’s is a cathedral, although Saint Peter’s is more of a church technically.\r\n<ol start="5">\r\n	<li><strong><em>Geography</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThe book’s storyline that the “Albino Monk” was arrested in France, imprisoned in Andorra and escaped to Spain, demonstrates the lack of basic research that would be gleaned from a quick glance at a map or tourist guide. It is improbable that someone arrested along the French coast would be imprisoned in another country (in this case Andorra which is a different jurisdiction and several hundred kilometers away up in the Pyrenean Mountains). After the scene in the Temple Church, London, the heroes of the story take the tube from Temple Station to King’s College. In fact King’s College is nearer to the Temple Church than to Temple Station, and any tube journey would have carried them further away from King’s College. Brown also states “The chapel’s geographic coordinates fall precisely on the north-south meridian that runs through Glastonbury”. This statement is incorrect: Rosslyn Chapel lies more towards the east-west meridian.

Simply out of curiosity. The child answered, “What is a m..mile..milestone?” The teacher smiled and explained, “A milestone is an important event in someone’s life. Like when you turn ten years old or when you go to college!” The child thought for a minute and said, “My dad got me my first basketball yesterday. I think that was an important event in my life.”\r\n\r\nA son asked his father, what to him was his life’s most cherished milestone. “There are many”, the father said, “but the day I married your mother has been my most favourite ever since.”\r\n\r\nA friend asked her 38-year old, National Award winning Kathak teacher, what her single most important milestone in life was. She said, “I beat Cancer. Twice.”\r\n\r\nMy sister told me a few days ago that I must go out for drinks with her whenever I would visit her next. I asked her if she would be willing to look out for me if I went about hurling everywhere after. “Yes!”, she said. “Those are milestones too.”\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/images1111.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-241 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/images1111.jpg" alt="images111" width="276" height="183" /></a>\r\n\r\nEach of us, no matter how old we are or where we come from, has a list of things that we might have achieved or are hopeful about achieving. When we strike out some things off that list, we call them milestones- things that remind us how far we have come, the things we witnessed on the way, the sacrifices we made to get where we are, and all that lies ahead.\r\n\r\nOne year is a long time. 365 days, 8,760 hours, 52,56,000 minutes and 3,15,36,000 seconds. Every moment is a new memory made. Every breath, every step, every sigh, every thought, every blink of the eye, every sight- is unique in its own way. When we put these elements in a string together, the multidimensional image of our one by gone year emerges.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/images-6.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-239 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/images-6.jpg" alt="images (6)" width="275" height="183" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne year since you found your soul mate, one year since you got that car you had been saving all your life for, one year since you took that trip with your best friends, one year since your brother started attending school, one year since your dog passed away after having lived a long and healthy life, one year since your twins turned one, one year since that house got burned down, one year since you moved to a new continent, one year since you made a million new memories, since you shed a few tears, since you laughed so hard you could feel the pressure in your head- one year since you lived.\r\n\r\nThe past year has been special to the team of The Book Hub too. I asked the Owner-Developer to tell me how it all started. He said, “<em>Main bore ho raha tha. Mere paas bohot saari e-books padi thien. Sabko ek jagah upload kiya aur chaar pages ki website bana daali!</em>” (When I started out, I only did it to avoid getting bored. I had a lot of e-books, so I uploaded them at one place and created a four-page long website.) I was amazed, and to be honest, slightly disappointed. I was looking for something more solid, deep and meaningful behind the making of this website. And all I was given was “<em>boriyat</em>” (boredom). This was exactly when it struck me that we keep waiting for good things to shape up amidst much pomp and show while forgetting to realise that “life is what happens to us when we are busy making plans”, that life’s most magnificent pleasures are hidden away in the simplest folds of its fabric.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/images-7.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-238 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/images-7.jpg" alt="images (7)" width="267" height="189" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe Book Hub began with a handful of college-going kids, brought together by the shared passion for books and a deep-seated interest in technology. And here we are- 365 days, 15,000 visitors (and counting) and with an outreach to over 20 countries later- celebrating our first milestone; growing slowly, yet steadily. So imperative and valuable are these events- those that have kept so many of us going; that gave us a reason to start afresh, to keep trying our hands at what we want to do, to bridge the gap between where we are and where we want to be, to believe in the miracle that is human life.\r\n\r\nI am reminded of something Shri Shri Ranbir Kapoorji said in one of his motion pictures that aids my purpose here, “<em>Kahin par pohonchane ke liye, kahin se nikalna bohot zaroori hota hai!</em>” (In order to get somewhere, it is necessary that we get away from somewhere!). Rightfully so.

They are greedy (Shylock), ambitious (Macbeth), broken (Voldemort), vengeful (Maleficent) and desirable (Jennifer in Jennifer''s Body).

Non-fiction is considered boring and dull, and often not of interest to those who do not, in general have an interest towards say history or current affairs. The situation is such that many people do not even consider reading non-fiction because in their minds they have a preconceived notion that it will not appeal to them.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone" src="http://authorearnings.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/50000-unit-sales-by-category1.jpg" alt="" width="303" height="256" /></p>\r\nI began reading when I was in third or fourth grade and read only fiction till I was in tenth grade. It so happened that somewhere in tenth grade a friend suggested I should read the autobiography of Andre Agassi titled ‘Open’. Although initially I was totally against the idea, I decided to give it a try and the book opened for me a new world. The world of non-fiction. Coming back to the original question. Why should you read non-fiction (or at least give it a try)? Here’s why:\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/1b/b3/88/1bb38852971f5ecc08349fc31ad5244e.jpg" alt="" width="289" height="385" /></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>You come across many different subjects and real-world situations. Reading non-fiction gets you in touch with issues such as Satanism, life of drug dealers, youth culture and capitalism, youth racial relations, dynamics of bullying in middle school students, role of social media in the 2010 Egyptian uprisings, etc.</li>\r\n	<li>You’ll learn to value people as human-beings and not as superhuman emotional saviors. In most fiction novels, the hero of the plot often has superhuman like capabilities. Be it Robert Langdon, James Bond, Hercule Poirot, Nancy Drew or others. Be it stories of loyalty, bravery, romance or betrayal, the books often have many scenes which. In a real-world scenario would be impossible to replicate. Non-fiction on the other hand tells you exactly how things work.</li>\r\n	<li>Reading non-fiction gives practical, daily life-applicable knowledge that can be used to interact with others. For a discussion on fiction, all the parties taking part must have read the subject partly or wholly, but that is not the case with non-fiction. In case of non-fiction the subjects are such that everyone will have their opinions about the matter. Subjects like the Human Rights abuse in Guatanamo Bay can garner a more productive discussion than say the life of David Copperfield.</li>\r\n	<li>You can impart knowledge. Say you read S. Hussain Zaidi’s ‘Dongri to Dubai, Six Decades of the Mumbai Mafia’, you will have a lot of anecdotes and incidents about the lives of the dons of Mumbai to intrigue others with, or if you have read Rafael Nadal’s autobiography, ‘Rafa: My Story’, you will be able to tell tales of the determination and hard-work that made him on the best tennis players ever.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<img class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://tejasghetia.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/dongri-to-dubai.jpeg" alt="" width="204" height="318" />                 <img class="alignnone aligncenter" src="http://img5a.flixcart.com/image/book/7/3/3/rafa-my-story-400x400-imad9g9gx2abtppq.jpeg" alt="" width="200" height="313" />\r\n\r\nReading non-fiction comes with its own set of assets. Do not try to answer the question of whether you will like it or not without giving it a try. To help you start, I’ll also add a list of books you can begin with, apart from the ones I have already mentioned.\r\n\r\n<img class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/57/NoEasyDayCoverArt.jpg" alt="" width="209" height="314" />                <img class="alignnone aligncenter" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KP9Pb8HKL.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="294" />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Unbroken: A World War II Story, Laura Hillenbrand</li>\r\n	<li>A Short History of Nearly Everything, Bill Bryson</li>\r\n	<li>Black Boy, Richard Wright</li>\r\n	<li>The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold in the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Daniel James Brown</li>\r\n	<li>Black Hawk Down, Mark Bowden</li>\r\n	<li>No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission that Killed Osama bin Laden, Mark Owen and Kevin Maurer</li>\r\n	<li>From Byculla to Bangkok, S.

I can''t hear you Piya!"\n\n"Look behind at that.."\n\nI''ve been a regular at public speaking competitions, winning most of them. I pride myself on my speaking skills, the debates I win, the speeches I give, that enthrall crowds. And yet, that day, I could do nothing to prevent the words from dying in their wake. \n\nBeings of varied proportions; Some make one inclined to tearing their hair out while some of these beings make one gratuitous. And the best thing is that almost all the time, both of them are same person. The only kind of godsend capable of making one cry, laugh, smile and fume. They''re called brothers. \n\nMy brother, he was a mixture of all. My go-to person, my literary critic, listening with a patient ear to all my exploits, and when I had finally finished rambling, he would either pass a sarcastic comment or snide me, depending on the content of my stories. Being four years elder to me, he bossed me around like I was a toddler. He would hit me, tease me, and irritate me as much as he wanted to, but at the same time, couldn''t bear a single tear in my eye. May the lord be with the person who had caused it, for he wouldn''t hesitate to give that person a piece of his mind, even if that person happened to be our mother.\n\nComing to my mother. She''s a pretty, kind lady who makes the world more beautiful by her mere presence. When asked about her children, she always had the same answer, “Abhay and Piya! Sweethearts they are. They are the reason my eyes twinkle, my heart beats and my life seems worthwhile!” \n\nThere was however, just one slight anomaly to this otherwise perfect woman.   She was jealous of her children. My mother, rather, our mother was jealous of us, her Abhay and Piya, her sweethearts. She had always imagined that she would be her children’s best friend, the first person they would turn to, whether they wanted to crack a joke or share their troubles. But Abhay and me, we had each other. To us, the world didn’t seem worth living in if either of us didn’t exist. We had made an promised each other, in our own childish way, that we would always tell each other everything first, never let anyone or anything come in between us, and stay together, forever. Little did I know, that destiny would do whatever it could, just to prove us wrong.\n\nSince the day I was born, Abhay was used to taking care of me. He was fascinated by my little antics. Every sound that escaped my lips, every little shake of my limbs had to be applauded by him. Mom tells me, he used to speak to me for hours at a stretch, in his own toddler language, his enthusiasm never fleeting. His protective attitude bordered on extremes; he would not trust anyone, family or foe, even when it came to them taking me in their lap. And if they somehow forced me away from him, he would hover there, eyes like a hawk, watching their every action, like a guardian angel, ensuring my safety. \n\nHe took it upon himself to teach me how to speak. And being the dutiful sister I always was, the first word I said was not ‘dada’ (the Bengali word for brother), inviting a fresh round of fury to my mother''s emotions. It was with him that I used to crawl around the house. It was with his support that I took my first steps. It was he who I had eyes for at the park whereas every other child would be escorted by their father. It was because of him that I didn’t shed a single tear while going to school, because I always knew I’d find him there. It was he who had to be there beside me while I revised the alphabet, though it was mom who was teaching me. And it was him, at the end of the day, the person I needed near me while mom sang me to sleep. It was in his presence, even then, that I felt most safe and secure.\n\nAs we grew up, it was him I turned to for advice, be it about friends, studies or boys. He was the first person I used to tell about my fights with my friends. It was he whom I asked for help while stuck over a math problem. It was he who I confided in first about my first crush and consequently, my first heart break. Looking back, I cannot remember a single moment I didn’t feel his need. That doesn’t mean we didn’t fight. But it was always over the silliest things, like who would eat the last slice of pizza or who would switch off the light at night. \n\nI remember the way he used to behave when his friends were over. When we were little, I used to play with his friends all day long, and he didn’t have any problem. But, when I, in his words “blossomed from a bud into a beautiful flower”, he wouldn’t even let me be in the same room with him and his friends, let alone speak to them. He didn’t have a problem with me speaking to boys; it was just ‘his’ boys. He knew exactly how his friends were and he didn’t want me near them, at all. I was his sweet little sister, and he wanted me to stay that way.\n\nI always had someone to walk with, be it to tuitions, to my bus stop, to the nearby stationery shop or to the grocery shop across the road. There were two reasons for this- one, we loved walking together and second, living in Kolkata, it wasn’t safe for me to walk alone. And according to Abhay, there was a third reason as well- apparently; I didn’t know how to cross the road. Which, in a way, was true. It wasn’t like I didn’t know; it was just that I didn’t have the patience to wait for all the cars to go. And Abhay, being the over-protective brother he was, would obviously not let me go alone.\n\nMom and Dad would often leave us alone at home and go for their social parties. With Abhay around, they were not scared and they had no reason to be. That night also they did the same. They gave the home keys to Abhay and went. As per our routine, as soon as they stepped in the lift, music started blaring and we started practicing salsa. It was a well kept secret, for no one but I knew, that Abhay wanted to desperately learn salsa, but was too ashamed to admit it. I had taken matters in my own hands and being a good dancer, had started teaching him. We danced around the house for about an hour and fell on the sofa, exhausted.\n\nDinner that day was a quiet affair as both as we were engrossed in the television and too tired to speak. Suddenly, an advertisement about chocolate started playing. My taste buds started tingling. Coincidentally, the succeeding advertisement was about ice cream. I suddenly started craving ice cream. I started asking, demanding, pleading, nagging and even begging to Abhay to let me go out and eat ice cream and come. But unsurprisingly, he didn’t allow me. I put on my puppy dog face and emotionally blackmail him. I relentlessly kept on trying. Finally, he altered my conditions and came up with what at that time seemed a brilliant plan. He proposed that he’d go and get me my ice cream, while I stayed inside the house and he locked me from outside. Desperate to eat my ice cream, I readily agreed.\n\nHe did as he had suggested, locked me in and went. I went to the balcony and was watching him. So eager was I to eat my ice cream, I was urging him by shouting from my balcony to go fast. He was crossing the road at that time. Continuing to walk, he turned back to stick his tongue out at me and started knowingly walking slowly just to irritate me. I was about to shout at him again when what happened the next second changed my life. My scream died in my throat and my eyes widened with horror. So engrossed we were in our playful banter that none of us had noticed the busy street around him. We were, as usual, lost in our own world. By the time I saw the truck, it was too late…\n\nEverything that happened next is a blur. I saw a body, a large crimson stain and I started mumbling incoherently. The truck driver leapt out, his face an echo of the mask of horror I was wearing. There was however, a slight difference. In his eyes, there was fear; fear of what had happened and fear of what would happen. A large group of people crowded around the body, cutting off my view entirely. It was then that my voice came back to me. I started screaming, shouting at anyone and everyone who was present to help my brother, my Abhay, my angel. The people just stood there, unresponsive. They were simply staring, doing nothing to help. I didn’t want to go away from there, but I had no other option. I ran to the door and tried to open it. But it wouldn’t budge! I realized Abhay had locked me. I couldn’t go out!\n\nI ran back to the balcony, and endless stream of tears running down my face. I tried shouting again, to somehow get those lifeless and emotionless people to help, but they stayed still, just like statues. There was not even a flicker of life or recognition in their eyes. I gave up hope on them. I somehow controlled my tears and called an ambulance. Damn this country and the government and the cars and their owners, I thought, unable to resist but curse India, a nation where pizza comes before an ambulance does. I then called mom and dad up, and was just able to manage a ‘Come back home right now!’ before I broke down again. \n\nMom, being a mother, realized that something was wrong just by hearing my voice and rushed back home with dad. Those 10 minutes it took them to reach home were hell. Standing there, seeing my brother breathe his last before my own eyes, locked up in my only safe sanctuary, my house which now seemed like a prison and the railing like the bars, helpless. It is a feeling that cannot be described. It can just be felt. And those unlucky few who have felt it will agree, it is a feeling better not felt.\n\nFinally, finally my parents reached. And they brought with them the welcome sound of the ambulance siren, which otherwise I always thought to be ominous. My dad raced up, unlocked me and we ran back down. Mom stayed with Abhay, crying and screaming at the attendants to hurry and lift him up on the stretcher. The three of us climbed in, none of us speaking, our labored breaths the only sound apart from the beep of the monitors attached to Abhay. And then there was a change in the sound of the monitor which was measuring his heartbeat…..\n\nAbhay died that day. I lost my brother, my best friend, my world. There’s a hole in my chest that grows every minute. I unintentionally associate everything happening around me with him, making me feel like there are claws scratching on the edges of that hole. It feels like I’m living in a vacuum. There’s an emptiness around me, which no matter how many people I am with, doesn’t get filled. When you build your world around someone and that person no longer stays in it, everything comes crumbling down because there’s no one to hold it up. I lost everything that day. \n\nI lost my brother because I wanted to eat a stupid ice cream and didn’t have the common sense to not disturb him while he was crossing the road. I lost him because I’m the most selfish person in the world who had the best brother anyone could ever have. I lost him because I never deserved him. \n\nIt’s been almost a year since I lost Abhay, and myself, and there’s a wall around me that I can’t break. Life has ceased to have any meaning for me now. I eat, I sleep, I study, I cry and I breathe. But that’s all I do. I’m a walking zombie. My eyes no longer have any emotion in them. They are a true reflection of what I’m feeling inside. The pain washes over me every second I’m awake. \n\nI’m waiting for my mind to stop reacting, the tears to stop falling and my emotions to stop disillusioning me. I’m waiting for the day when I’ll be able to accept that Abhay actually has gone. I’m waiting for the time when I stop looking around for Abhay, and have him tell me it was all just a silly prank he was playing on me. I’m waiting for my ears to stop straining, trying to listen to his full-throated laugh again. I’m waiting for my heart beat to not increase whenever I see a tall guy with dark hair walk by.

I can''t hear you Piya!"\n\n"Look behind at that.."\n\nI''ve been a regular at public speaking competitions, winning most of them. I pride myself on my speaking skills, the debates I win, the speeches I give, that enthrall crowds. And yet, that day, I could do nothing to prevent the words from dying in their wake. \n\nBeings of varied proportions; Some make one inclined to tearing their hair out while some of these beings make one gratuitous. And the best thing is that almost all the time, both of them are same person. The only kind of godsend capable of making one cry, laugh, smile and fume. They''re called brothers. \n\nMy brother, he was a mixture of all. My go-to person, my literary critic, listening with a patient ear to all my exploits, and when I had finally finished rambling, he would either pass a sarcastic comment or snide me, depending on the content of my stories. Being four years elder to me, he bossed me around like I was a toddler. He would hit me, tease me, and irritate me as much as he wanted to, but at the same time, couldn''t bear a single tear in my eye. May the lord be with the person who had caused it, for he wouldn''t hesitate to give that person a piece of his mind, even if that person happened to be our mother.\n\nComing to my mother. She''s a pretty, kind lady who makes the world more beautiful by her mere presence. When asked about her children, she always had the same answer, “Abhay and Piya! Sweethearts they are. They are the reason my eyes twinkle, my heart beats and my life seems worthwhile!” \n\nThere was however, just one slight anomaly to this otherwise perfect woman.   She was jealous of her children. My mother, rather, our mother was jealous of us, her Abhay and Piya, her sweethearts. She had always imagined that she would be her children’s best friend, the first person they would turn to, whether they wanted to crack a joke or share their troubles. But Abhay and me, we had each other. To us, the world didn’t seem worth living in if either of us didn’t exist. We had made an promised each other, in our own childish way, that we would always tell each other everything first, never let anyone or anything come in between us, and stay together, forever. Little did I know, that destiny would do whatever it could, just to prove us wrong.\n\nSince the day I was born, Abhay was used to taking care of me. He was fascinated by my little antics. Every sound that escaped my lips, every little shake of my limbs had to be applauded by him. Mom tells me, he used to speak to me for hours at a stretch, in his own toddler language, his enthusiasm never fleeting. His protective attitude bordered on extremes; he would not trust anyone, family or foe, even when it came to them taking me in their lap. And if they somehow forced me away from him, he would hover there, eyes like a hawk, watching their every action, like a guardian angel, ensuring my safety. \n\nHe took it upon himself to teach me how to speak. And being the dutiful sister I always was, the first word I said was not ‘dada’ (the Bengali word for brother), inviting a fresh round of fury to my mother''s emotions. It was with him that I used to crawl around the house. It was with his support that I took my first steps. It was he who I had eyes for at the park whereas every other child would be escorted by their father. It was because of him that I didn’t shed a single tear while going to school, because I always knew I’d find him there. It was he who had to be there beside me while I revised the alphabet, though it was mom who was teaching me. And it was him, at the end of the day, the person I needed near me while mom sang me to sleep. It was in his presence, even then, that I felt most safe and secure.\n\nAs we grew up, it was him I turned to for advice, be it about friends, studies or boys. He was the first person I used to tell about my fights with my friends. It was he whom I asked for help while stuck over a math problem. It was he who I confided in first about my first crush and consequently, my first heart break. Looking back, I cannot remember a single moment I didn’t feel his need. That doesn’t mean we didn’t fight. But it was always over the silliest things, like who would eat the last slice of pizza or who would switch off the light at night. \n\nI remember the way he used to behave when his friends were over. When we were little, I used to play with his friends all day long, and he didn’t have any problem. But, when I, in his words “blossomed from a bud into a beautiful flower”, he wouldn’t even let me be in the same room with him and his friends, let alone speak to them. He didn’t have a problem with me speaking to boys; it was just ‘his’ boys. He knew exactly how his friends were and he didn’t want me near them, at all. I was his sweet little sister, and he wanted me to stay that way.\n\nI always had someone to walk with, be it to tuitions, to my bus stop, to the nearby stationery shop or to the grocery shop across the road. There were two reasons for this- one, we loved walking together and second, living in Kolkata, it wasn’t safe for me to walk alone. And according to Abhay, there was a third reason as well- apparently; I didn’t know how to cross the road. Which, in a way, was true. It wasn’t like I didn’t know; it was just that I didn’t have the patience to wait for all the cars to go. And Abhay, being the over-protective brother he was, would obviously not let me go alone.\n\nMom and Dad would often leave us alone at home and go for their social parties. With Abhay around, they were not scared and they had no reason to be. That night also they did the same. They gave the home keys to Abhay and went. As per our routine, as soon as they stepped in the lift, music started blaring and we started practicing salsa. It was a well kept secret, for no one but I knew, that Abhay wanted to desperately learn salsa, but was too ashamed to admit it. I had taken matters in my own hands and being a good dancer, had started teaching him. We danced around the house for about an hour and fell on the sofa, exhausted.\n\nDinner that day was a quiet affair as both as we were engrossed in the television and too tired to speak. Suddenly, an advertisement about chocolate started playing. My taste buds started tingling. Coincidentally, the succeeding advertisement was about ice cream. I suddenly started craving ice cream. I started asking, demanding, pleading, nagging and even begging to Abhay to let me go out and eat ice cream and come. But unsurprisingly, he didn’t allow me. I put on my puppy dog face and emotionally blackmail him. I relentlessly kept on trying. Finally, he altered my conditions and came up with what at that time seemed a brilliant plan. He proposed that he’d go and get me my ice cream, while I stayed inside the house and he locked me from outside. Desperate to eat my ice cream, I readily agreed.\n\nHe did as he had suggested, locked me in and went. I went to the balcony and was watching him. So eager was I to eat my ice cream, I was urging him by shouting from my balcony to go fast. He was crossing the road at that time. Continuing to walk, he turned back to stick his tongue out at me and started knowingly walking slowly just to irritate me. I was about to shout at him again when what happened the next second changed my life. My scream died in my throat and my eyes widened with horror. So engrossed we were in our playful banter that none of us had noticed the busy street around him. We were, as usual, lost in our own world. By the time I saw the truck, it was too late…\n\nEverything that happened next is a blur. I saw a body, a large crimson stain and I started mumbling incoherently. The truck driver leapt out, his face an echo of the mask of horror I was wearing. There was however, a slight difference. In his eyes, there was fear; fear of what had happened and fear of what would happen. A large group of people crowded around the body, cutting off my view entirely. It was then that my voice came back to me. I started screaming, shouting at anyone and everyone who was present to help my brother, my Abhay, my angel. The people just stood there, unresponsive. They were simply staring, doing nothing to help. I didn’t want to go away from there, but I had no other option. I ran to the door and tried to open it. But it wouldn’t budge! I realized Abhay had locked me. I couldn’t go out!\n\nI ran back to the balcony, and endless stream of tears running down my face. I tried shouting again, to somehow get those lifeless and emotionless people to help, but they stayed still, just like statues. There was not even a flicker of life or recognition in their eyes. I gave up hope on them. I somehow controlled my tears and called an ambulance. Damn this country and the government and the cars and their owners, I thought, unable to resist but curse India, a nation where pizza comes before an ambulance does. I then called mom and dad up, and was just able to manage a ‘Come back home right now!’ before I broke down again. \n\nMom, being a mother, realized that something was wrong just by hearing my voice and rushed back home with dad. Those 10 minutes it took them to reach home were hell. Standing there, seeing my brother breathe his last before my own eyes, locked up in my only safe sanctuary, my house which now seemed like a prison and the railing like the bars, helpless. It is a feeling that cannot be described. It can just be felt. And those unlucky few who have felt it will agree, it is a feeling better not felt.\n\nFinally, finally my parents reached. And they brought with them the welcome sound of the ambulance siren, which otherwise I always thought to be ominous. My dad raced up, unlocked me and we ran back down. Mom stayed with Abhay, crying and screaming at the attendants to hurry and lift him up on the stretcher. The three of us climbed in, none of us speaking, our labored breaths the only sound apart from the beep of the monitors attached to Abhay. And then there was a change in the sound of the monitor which was measuring his heartbeat…..\n\nAbhay died that day. I lost my brother, my best friend, my world. There’s a hole in my chest that grows every minute. I unintentionally associate everything happening around me with him, making me feel like there are claws scratching on the edges of that hole. It feels like I’m living in a vacuum. There’s an emptiness around me, which no matter how many people I am with, doesn’t get filled. When you build your world around someone and that person no longer stays in it, everything comes crumbling down because there’s no one to hold it up. I lost everything that day. \n\nI lost my brother because I wanted to eat a stupid ice cream and didn’t have the common sense to not disturb him while he was crossing the road. I lost him because I’m the most selfish person in the world who had the best brother anyone could ever have. I lost him because I never deserved him. \n\nIt’s been almost a year since I lost Abhay, and myself, and there’s a wall around me that I can’t break. Life has ceased to have any meaning for me now. I eat, I sleep, I study, I cry and I breathe. But that’s all I do. I’m a walking zombie. My eyes no longer have any emotion in them. They are a true reflection of what I’m feeling inside. The pain washes over me every second I’m awake. \n\nI’m waiting for my mind to stop reacting, the tears to stop falling and my emotions to stop disillusioning me. I’m waiting for the day when I’ll be able to accept that Abhay actually has gone. I’m waiting for the time when I stop looking around for Abhay, and have him tell me it was all just a silly prank he was playing on me. I’m waiting for my ears to stop straining, trying to listen to his full-throated laugh again. I’m waiting for my heart beat to not increase whenever I see a tall guy with dark hair walk by. I’m waiting for the guilt to pass. I’m waiting for my mom to stop crying whenever she looks at me. I’m waiting for dad to crack a smile. My foolish, yearning heart overrules my mind and is and will always be waiting for Abhay to come back.\n\nWritten by Mahima Agarwala', 'Waiting', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '265-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-07-08 18:57:37', '2015-07-08 13:27:37', '', 265, 'http://blog.thebookhub.in/265-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Women Empowerment and Feminism are such things too. These issues deserve paramount importance, no doubt; but not before we correctly understand them. These concepts are not anti-men. In the prospect of  focussing on how important women are to the world and mankind, which we are, one tends to forget that men are just as important.\r\n\r\nWe all have grown up in the presence of a number of men- who were, or still are, some of the most important people in our lives. Fathers, brothers, uncles and friends are the first few men who familiarise us women, with how the other fifty percent of the world functions.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/86517926.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-269 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/86517926-300x200.jpg" alt="86517926" width="300" height="200" /></a>\r\n\r\nI remember distinctly, how my father would wake up every morning with me, get me ready for school, prepare my lunch and drop me off. I remember him being there for me at every school event, or for that matter, everywhere I ever went. Even today, I see him treat my friends like children of his own. In this regard, brothers are no less. My brother looked after me when I did not keep well, bought me a candy when he saved some money as a kid, decorated the house with balloons for my birthday party and covered my books when I was too naive to do so myself. So, I grew up believing that I could be most safe in the presence of men like these.\r\n\r\nIn my adolescence, I was never allowed to leave home alone, or wear skirts/shorts outside of the house, or play outdoors after the sun set; the reason for which I did not understand. I questioned these decisions of my parents time and again. To my dismay, I was rarely ever given clear answers. I eventually got accustomed to the setting. As I moved from school to college, I made friends in the opposite gender too, not one of which I had back in school. My speaking to them over the phone or going out with them was no less than a culture shock to my parents. Again, I was not certain as to why.\r\n\r\nMoving to a new city entailed that I travelled a lot, most of it on my own. Buses, cabs, trains- you name it! In the process, I obviously encountered many strangers- many male strangers. Old, young, educated, uneducated, decent looking and creepy looking. But the one thing that tied them in a single thread for me was, how they would look at me, or rather my body. For that matter, any female that they may come across. Most of these men had no courage to meet eyes with us, but leering at our breasts was absolutely no problem at all. They gave away their seats if they saw an old woman standing in a bus, but deliberately running a hand over a young girl’s waist or butt was also something they did with equal ease and convenience. And mind you, this happened with women clad in western wear as well as those donning a <em>burkha</em>. Such paradoxical display of behaviour in men was beyond me.\r\n\r\n<span style="line-height: 1.5">I have been having some trouble understanding how there is such stark contradiction in the way men conduct themselves in public. The brother who cannot stand his sister speaking to another guy in the street, himself whistles at young girls with a cigarette in his hand and a cheap song on his lips. I am struggling to comprehend as to why the attitude of men towards different women is governed by dissimilar rules. Just because I am a stranger to another man, does that entitle him to misbehave with me? I was being given the answers to the questions my parents once left unanswered.</span>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/eve-teasing02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-272 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/eve-teasing02-300x140.jpg" alt="Eve teasing has been considered as a henious crime in developed countries taking its consequences in mind .

Women have always had faith in the fact that men make superb fathers, terrific husbands and great brothers- which is why we look out for them and also seek their help and companionship. For many of us, our male counterparts are true treasures- not just because they introduced us to a different side of the world, but also because they make very good friends. We turn to our fathers for advice, our brothers for support and our best friends for a shoulder to cry on. There are so many things that we find impossible to explain to our mothers, sisters and female friends that the men easily get. So sometimes, they are just as a girl friend to us as we are a “bro” to them.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/images-8.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-273 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/images-8.jpg" alt="images (8)" width="242" height="208" /></a>\r\n\r\nReal men are an embodiment of chivalry, courage and righteousness. One seldom comes across women misbehaving with men in public places. We give them the space and the respect that is rightfully theirs. The least we deserve in return is to be treated with equal respect and not be torn apart, deprived of our basic dignity. The way men treat us has a deep impact on our minds, regardless of how ever much we would like it to be otherwise. Indecency by males only tars the untainted images our fathers, brothers, husbands and friends have created for us. Take a step back and think.  We are, because you are. You are, because we are.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/download-1.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-274 aligncenter" src="http://blog.thebookhub.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/download-1.jpg" alt="download (1)" width="338" height="253" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDear Men,\r\nWith love.', 'Dear Men, With Love', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'dear-men-with-love', '', '', '2015-07-11 17:52:42', '2015-07-11 12:22:42', '', 0, 'http://blog.thebookhub.in/?p=268', 0, 'post', '', 12);
